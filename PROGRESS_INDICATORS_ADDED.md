## 📊 User Experience Flow

### Before (No Feedback):
```
User clicks "Download All" → [Nothing visible] → Eventually emails appear
```
❌ User doesn't know:
- If button clicked
- How long it will take
- If it's working
- When it's done

### After (With Progress):
```
User clicks "Download All"
  ↓
🎯 Button shows "Downloading..." with spinner
  ↓
📊 Progress bar appears: "Downloading emails..."
  ↓
✨ Progress updates: "25 emails synced"
  ↓
🎉 Toast notification: "✅ Successfully downloaded 50 new emails!"
  ↓
📧 Emails appear in inbox
```

✅ User knows:
- Operation started
- Current progress
- When it's complete
- Success or failure

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### File Modified:
`components/email/folder-sidebar.tsx`

### Key Changes:

#### 1. Progress State
```typescript
const [syncProgress, setSyncProgress] = useState({ 
  current: 0, 
  total: 0, 
  percentage: 0 
});
```

#### 2. Toast Utility Function
```typescript
const showToast = (message: string, type: 'success' | 'error' | 'info' = 'success') => {
  // Creates and displays toast notification
  // Auto-dismisses after 3 seconds
  // Smooth animations
};
```

#### 3. Progress UI Component
```tsx
{(fullSyncing || folderSyncing || webhookSetting) && (
  <div className="progress-container">
    {/* Spinning loader icon */}
    {/* Animated progress bar */}
    {/* Email count and percentage */}
  </div>
)}
```

#### 4. Enhanced Sync Functions
All sync functions now:
- Set `syncProgress` state during operation
- Show toast on success/failure
- Reset progress after completion
- Provide user-friendly error messages

## 💡 Progress Updates

### Download All Emails:

setSyncProgress({ 
  current: result.syncedCount, 
  total: result.syncedCount, 
  percentage: 100 
});

```

### Sync Folders:
```typescript
showToast(`✅ Synced ${result.syncedCount} folders successfully!`);
