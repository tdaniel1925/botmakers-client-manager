**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Status:** Reverted & Simplified

## 📋 What Changed

Successfully reverted the campaign wizards back to their simple 3-step flow, removing the complex "Contacts, Schedule and Follow-Up" step.

---

## ✅ Changes Completed

### 1. Manual Wizard Simplified
**File:** `components/voice-campaigns/campaign-wizard.tsx`

- ✅ Removed `contactsScheduleConfig` state
- ✅ Removed ContactsScheduleConfig component import
- ✅ Updated step navigation (3 steps now)
- ✅ Removed contacts-schedule step rendering
- ✅ Updated preview step (back to simple scheduleConfig)
- ✅ Simplified handleGenerateCampaign (no contacts/SMS/email data)

**Step Flow:** `basic-info` → `phone-number` → `preview` → `generating` → `testing`

### 2. AI Wizard Simplified
**File:** `components/voice-campaigns/ai-campaign-wizard.tsx`

- ✅ Removed `"contacts-schedule"` from WizardStep type
- ✅ Removed `contactsScheduleConfig` state

**Step Flow:** `conversation` → `phone-number` → `generating` → `testing`

### 3. Database Schema Preserved
**Files:** 
- `db/schema/voice-campaigns-schema.ts` ✅
- `db/migrations/0042_add_automation_settings.sql` ✅

**Kept:**
- `smsSettings` JSONB column
- `emailSettings` JSONB column
- `scheduleConfig` JSONB column

These will be used for post-creation automation features.

### 4. Authorization Fix
**File:** `actions/voice-campaign-actions.ts`

- ✅ Removed blocking platform admin check
- ✅ Kept isAdmin check for admin-free campaigns
- ✅ Users can now create campaigns regardless of platformAdminsTable status

## 🎯 Current State

### Wizard Flow (Simplified)

**Both wizards now have simple, focused steps:**

1. **Campaign Setup** - Basic agent configuration
2. **Phone Number** - Select/provision number
3. **Preview** - Review and launch
4. **Generating** - AI creates the agent
5. **Testing** - Test the live agent

**Removed:**
- Contact upload
- SMS automation setup
- Email automation setup
- Outbound scheduling

**These are now post-creation features** (to be implemented separately)
