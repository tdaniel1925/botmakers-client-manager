## 📝 Notes

### Image Auto-Download:
Images are auto-downloaded by default via the CSS in `app/globals.css`:
```css
.email-body-content img {
  max-width: 100%;
  height: auto;
  /* No blocking - images load automatically */
}
```

To add a setting for this in the future, you would:
1. Add `autoDownloadImages` to `email_settings` table
2. Conditionally render images based on setting
3. Add toggle in Settings panel

### Email Speed:
The email client is fast because:
- Database queries are optimized with indexes
- AI summaries are cached
- Images are lazy-loaded
- Parallel data fetching
- Debounced auto-save
