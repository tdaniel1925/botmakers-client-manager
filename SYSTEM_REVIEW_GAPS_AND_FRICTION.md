## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES

### 1. **Hard Page Refreshes Everywhere**
**Problem:** `window.location.reload()` is used after every action (create, edit, pause, resume, delete)

**Impact:**
- Loses scroll position
- Flashes white screen
- Destroys component state
- Poor mobile experience
- Feels janky and unprofessional

**Files Affected:**
- `components/voice-campaigns/campaigns-page-wrapper.tsx` (lines 20, 42)
- `components/voice-campaigns/campaign-card.tsx` (lines 47, 59)

**Solution:**
- Use React state updates instead of hard refresh
- Implement optimistic UI updates
- Only refetch data when necessary

```typescript
// Instead of:
window.location.reload();

// Do this:
await loadCampaigns(); // Refetch just the campaigns
// Or even better - optimistic update:
setCampaigns(prev => prev.map(c => 
  c.id === campaignId ? { ...c, status: 'paused' } : c
));
```

**Effort:** 2-3 hours  
**Impact:** High - Dramatically improves UX

---

### 2. **No Cleanup on Failed Campaign Creation**
**Problem:** If campaign creation fails midway, orphaned resources are left behind

**Scenario:**
1. Webhook created ✅
2. Agent created with provider ✅
3. Phone number provisioning fails ❌
4. **Result:** Webhook and agent exist but campaign doesn't

**Impact:**
- Wastes provider resources
- Costs money (phone numbers, agents)
- Clutters provider dashboards
- No way to recover

**Files Affected:**
- `actions/voice-campaign-actions.ts` (lines 27-159)

**Solution:**
- Wrap entire creation in try-catch with rollback
- Implement transaction pattern
- Clean up resources on failure

```typescript
try {
  // Create resources
} catch (error) {
  // Rollback
  if (agent?.id) await provider.deleteAgent(agent.id);
  if (webhook?.id) await deleteWebhook(webhook.id);
  throw error;
}
```

**Effort:** 4-5 hours  
**Impact:** High - Prevents resource leaks

---

### 3. **No Campaign Detail/Analytics Page**
**Problem:** Users can only see basic stats on cards, no detailed analytics view

**Missing Features:**
- Call history/transcripts
- Performance trends
- Cost breakdown
- Agent performance metrics
- Webhook logs
- Edit full campaign config

**Impact:**
- Can't troubleshoot issues

- Can't optimize campaigns
- Limited editing capabilities

**Files Affected:**
- Missing entire feature

**Solution:**
- Create `/campaigns/[id]` detail page
- Show full analytics dashboard
- Allow editing of all campaign parameters
- Display call history with transcripts

**Effort:** 8-10 hours  
**Impact:** Very High - Core feature gap

---

### 4. **Limited Campaign Editing**
**Problem:** Can only edit name, description, and active status - can't update core configuration

**Can't Edit:**
- System prompts
- Agent personality
- Voice settings
- First message
- Data collection fields
- Conversation guidelines
- Working hours

**Impact:**
- Have to delete and recreate to make changes
- Lose all analytics/history
- Wastes phone numbers
- Poor user experience

**Files Affected:**
- `components/voice-campaigns/campaign-settings-dialog.tsx`
- `actions/voice-campaign-actions.ts`

**Solution:**
- Expand settings dialog to include all parameters
- Sync changes to voice provider
- Allow prompt editing with live preview

**Effort:** 6-8 hours  
**Impact:** High - Essential for iteration

---

### 5. **No Draft Mode**
**Problem:** Campaigns go live immediately upon creation - no way to save as draft

**Impact:**
- Can't prepare campaigns in advance
- No review before activation
- Risky for complex setups
- Can't collaborate on campaign setup

**Solution:**
- Add draft status
- Allow saving without activating
- Review step before going live

```typescript
const handleComplete = () => {
  if (userWantsToSaveDraft) {
    await createCampaign({ ...data, status: 'draft' });
  } else {
    await createCampaign({ ...data, status: 'active' });
  }
};
```

**Effort:** 2-3 hours  
**Impact:** Medium - Improves flexibility

---

### 6. **No Progress Save in Wizard**
**Problem:** If user leaves wizard mid-way, all progress is lost

**Impact:**
- Frustrating for complex campaigns
- Have to start over if interrupted
- Especially bad with AI Writer (generates good description, then lose it)

**Solution:**
- Save wizard state to localStorage
- Restore on return
- Add "Save Draft" button in wizard

**Effort:** 3-4 hours  
**Impact:** Medium - Reduces friction

---

### 7. **No Error Recovery UI**
**Problem:** If campaign creation fails, error message is shown but no way to retry

**Current Behavior:**
- Error toast shows
- Kicks back to questions step

**Solution:**
- Auto-poll for phone number status
- Show loading spinner while pending
- Update automatically when ready

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (phoneNumber === 'pending') {
    const interval = setInterval(async () => {
      const result = await checkPhoneNumberStatus(campaignId);
      if (result.number !== 'pending') {
        updateCampaignInList(campaignId, result);
        clearInterval(interval);
      }
    }, 5000); // Check every 5 seconds
    
    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }
}, [phoneNumber]);
```

**Effort:** 2 hours  
**Impact:** Medium - Smoother UX

---

### 9. **No Preview Before Submission**
**Problem:** Users don't see what will be generated until after campaign is created

- Add "Regenerate" button

**Effort:** 4-5 hours  
**Impact:** High - Improves confidence

---

### 10. **Native confirm() Dialog**
**Problem:** Delete confirmation uses browser's native `confirm()` instead of custom dialog

**Code:**
```typescript
if (!confirm(`Are you sure...`)) return;
```

**Impact:**
- Looks unprofessional
- Can't style or customize
- No mobile-friendly version
- Doesn't match app design

**Solution:**
- Use custom confirmation dialog component
- Add "Type campaign name to confirm" for safety
- Show what will be deleted (stats, phone number, etc.)

**Effort:** 1-2 hours  
**Impact:** Low - Polish

---

### 11. **No Campaign Duplication**
**Problem:** Can't clone successful campaigns

**Impact:**

- Pre-fill wizard with cloned data
- Allow editing before creating

**Effort:** 2-3 hours  
**Impact:** Medium - Time saver

---

### 12. **Twilio Support Not Clear**
**Problem:** Twilio phone numbers only work with Vapi, but this isn't clearly communicated

**Current:**
- Phone selector shows Twilio option for all providers
- Throws error at creation time if not Vapi

**Better:**
- Only show Twilio option for Vapi
- Or show grayed out with tooltip for other providers
- Clear messaging about provider limitations

**Effort:** 1 hour  
**Impact:** Medium - Reduces confusion

---

### 13. **No Cost Estimates**

**Effort:** 3-4 hours  
**Impact:** High - Financial transparency

---

### 14. **No Bulk Actions**
**Problem:** Can't pause/resume/delete multiple campaigns at once

**Impact:**
- Tedious for users with many campaigns
- No quick "pause all" option
- Time-consuming

**Solution:**
- Add checkboxes to campaign cards
- Bulk action toolbar
- "Select All" option

**Effort:** 4-5 hours  
**Impact:** Medium - Scalability

---

### 15. **No Campaign Templates**
