## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "No organization found"

### Can't drag deals on Kanban
**Solution:**

2. Clear browser cache
3. Try refreshing the page

### Loading states stuck
**Solution:**
1. Check `.env.local` for correct Supabase credentials
2. Verify database connection
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify migrations ran successfully: `npm run db:migrate`

### Permission denied errors
**Solution:**
1. Check your role in the database (`user_roles` table)
2. Log out and log back in
3. Contact organization admin

### Mobile layout issues
**Solution:**
1. Clear browser cache
2. Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
3. Check that Tailwind CSS is compiled correctly
