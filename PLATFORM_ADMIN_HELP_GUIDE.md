2. System checks message templates for matching triggers
3. If trigger matches, message is sent automatically
4. Message is personalized with call variables
5. Delivery is logged and tracked

### Accessing Campaign Messaging

2. Go to **SMS & Email** tab (Platform Admin only)
3. You'll see three sub-tabs:

**Example Triggers:**
```
Trigger 1: Call Completed + Sentiment is Positive
‚Üí Send thank you email

Trigger 2: Voicemail Left
‚Üí Send SMS with alternative contact method

- Real-time call handling

#### Twilio (Platform-Level)

**Used for:**
- SMS follow-ups (platform-wide default)
- Phone number provisioning (alternative to Vapi)

#### Resend (Platform-Level)

### Messaging Providers

#### Platform-Wide Credentials (Default)
Configure default credentials used by all organizations:

**Twilio (SMS)**
1. Go to **Settings ‚Üí Messaging ‚Üí Platform Credentials**
2. Enter:
   - **Account SID** (starts with AC)
   - **Auth Token**
   - **Phone Number** (format: +1234567890)
3. Click **Test Connection**
4. If successful, click **Save**

**Resend (Email)**
1. Go to **Settings ‚Üí Messaging ‚Üí Platform Credentials**
2. Enter:
   - **API Key** (starts with re_)
   - **From Email** (must be from verified domain)
3. Click **Test Connection**
4. If successful, click **Save**

**How It Works:**
- All campaigns use these credentials by default
- Shared rate limits across platform
- No per-organization configuration needed

#### Organization-Specific Credentials (BYOK)
Organizations can configure their own credentials for:
- Dedicated rate limits
- Direct cost control
- Full transparency in provider dashboards

**How BYOK Works:**
1. Organization goes to their **Settings ‚Üí Messaging** tab
2. Toggles on "Use Custom Twilio Account" or "Use Custom Email Service"
3. Enters their own credentials
4. System tests and verifies credentials
5. All messaging for that org uses their credentials

**Platform Admin View:**
- See which orgs have BYOK enabled
- View verification status
- Cannot see org credentials (security)

**Fallback Logic:**
- If org has BYOK enabled + verified ‚Üí Use org credentials
- Otherwise ‚Üí Use platform credentials
- If both fail ‚Üí Error logged, notification sent

#### Encryption & Security
- All credentials encrypted with AES-256-GCM
- Encryption key stored in environment variable
- Keys never displayed in full (masked)
- Credentials tested before saving
