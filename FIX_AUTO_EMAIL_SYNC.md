# üîß Fix: Emails Not Syncing Automatically

## ‚ùå Problem
New emails are not coming in automatically.

## ‚úÖ Solution (3 Steps)

### **Step 1: Add Environment Variables**

1. Open `codespring-boilerplate/.env.local`
2. Add these two lines:

```bash
# Background Email Sync
CRON_SECRET=k8WHAeF2SO7D3cJwMdZn6gQjLG4hVC9z
NYLAS_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-nylas-webhook-secret-here
```

3. **Get your Nylas Webhook Secret:**
   - Go to https://dashboard.nylas.com
   - Click "Webhooks" in left menu
   - Copy the webhook secret
   - Replace `your-nylas-webhook-secret-here` with it

### **Step 2: Restart Dev Server**

The server has been restarted automatically. Wait 10 seconds for it to fully start.

### **Step 3: Enable Webhooks for Your Account**

1. Go to http://localhost:3001/platform/emails (or /dashboard/emails)
2. Click the **"Enable Real-time"** button in the sidebar
3. Wait for "‚úì Real-time Enabled" to appear

## üß™ **Test It Works**

### **Option 1: Send yourself a test email**

1. Send an email to your connected account from another email
2. Open your email client (http://localhost:3001/platform/emails)
3. Email should appear **instantly** (within 1-2 seconds)

### **Option 2: Manual sync test**

Open a new terminal and run:

```bash
cd "C:\Users\tdani\One World Dropbox\Trent Daniel\1 - App Builds\botmakers-client-manager\codespring-boilerplate"
npm run test:sync
```

Expected output:
```
‚úÖ CRON_SECRET is set
‚úÖ NYLAS_WEBHOOK_SECRET is set
üìß Found 1 active email account(s)
   ‚Ä¢ Grant ID: ‚úÖ
   ‚Ä¢ Webhook ID: ‚úÖ webhook_123
‚úÖ Cron endpoint is working!
‚úÖ Background sync is ready to use!
```

---

## üîç **Check Webhook Status**

### **In Your Email Client:**
Look for this in the sidebar under "Enable Real-time" button:
- ‚úÖ **"‚úì Real-time Enabled"** = Webhooks working
- ‚ùå **Just the button** = Webhooks not set up

### **In Terminal Logs:**
When you send a test email, you should see:
```
Nylas webhook received: message.created
Created new email from webhook: msg_123
‚úÖ Email saved to database
```

---

## ‚ùì **Troubleshooting**

### **"Enable Real-time" button doesn't work**
- Make sure `NYLAS_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is correct
- Check terminal for error messages
- Try disconnecting and reconnecting your email account

### **Webhook says enabled but emails don't arrive**
- Check Nylas Dashboard ‚Üí Webhooks ‚Üí Delivery Logs
- Look for failed deliveries
- Verify webhook URL is: `http://localhost:3001/api/webhooks/nylas` (for local dev)

### **Test sync shows "No active accounts"**
- Connect an email account first
- Go to emails page ‚Üí "Add Account" ‚Üí Connect with Nylas

### **Still not working?**
1. Check browser console for errors (F12)
2. Check terminal logs for webhook messages
3. Verify your Nylas account has webhook permissions
4. Try the "Download All Emails" button as a fallback

## üìä **How Background Sync Works**

Once set up, emails sync in **two ways**:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Real-time (Webhooks)** - Instant ‚ö°
- Nylas sends your server a notification when email arrives
- Email appears in **< 1 second**
- **Requires**: `NYLAS_WEBHOOK_SECRET` + "Enable Real-time" button

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Scheduled (Cron)** - Every 15 minutes üîÑ
- Automatic backup sync
- Catches any missed emails
- **Requires**: `CRON_SECRET` + deployment to Vercel (or external cron service)
- **Note**: Only works in production, not local dev

**For local development**, you only need webhooks (step 3 above).

## ‚úÖ **Next Steps**

After fixing:

1. ‚úÖ Add environment variables to `.env.local`
2. ‚úÖ Dev server restarted automatically
3. ‚è≥ **Wait 10 seconds** for server to fully start
4. üìß Click "Enable Real-time" button
5. üß™ Send yourself a test email
6. üéâ Email should appear instantly!
