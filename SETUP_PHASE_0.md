## üéâ You're Done!

Phase 0 is complete and working. You now have:

‚úÖ Email system (Resend)  
‚úÖ File upload system (Supabase Storage)  
‚úÖ Test pages to verify both  
‚úÖ Ready for Phase 1 (Onboarding database)

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Email not sending?
- Check RESEND_API_KEY is correct
- Use `onboarding@resend.dev` for testing
- Check Resend dashboard for errors

### Upload failing?
- Verify bucket `onboarding-files` exists
- Check RLS policies are set
- Verify Supabase keys are correct
- Check file size < 25MB

### Server won't start?
- Run `npm install` again
- Delete `node_modules` and reinstall
- Check for TypeScript errors

---

## üìö Next: Phase 1

Once testing is complete, we'll build:
- Onboarding database schema
- Session management
- AI analysis system
