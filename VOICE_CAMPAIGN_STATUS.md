# Voice Campaign System - Status Report

## âœ… ISSUES FIXED

### 1. Phone Number Format Error (Vapi & Retell)
**Problem:** Error "A phone number must either be a string or an object of shape { phone, [country] }"

**Solution:**
- Changed Vapi test call from `{number: testPhoneNumber}` to direct string format
- Automatically formats phone numbers to E.164 format (+1234567890)
- Updated both Vapi and Retell providers

**Files Updated:**
- `lib/voice-providers/vapi-provider.ts` (line 285-302)
- `lib/voice-providers/retell-provider.ts` (line 202-219)

### 2. Phone Number Not Showing (Vapi)
**Problem:** Campaign created but phone number field was empty

**Solution:**
- Vapi's POST /phone-number doesn't return the actual number
- Now performs GET /phone-number/{id} after creation
- Fetches and stores the actual phone number
- Fallback to "pending" if fetch fails

**Files Updated:**
- `lib/voice-providers/vapi-provider.ts` (line 167-191)

### 3. Area Code Validation (Vapi)
**Problem:** Invalid area code caused API errors

**Solution:**
- Validates area code is exactly 3 digits
- Filters out empty strings
- Only sends to Vapi if valid
- Vapi assigns random number if no valid area code provided

**Files Updated:**
- `lib/voice-providers/vapi-provider.ts` (line 150-155)
- `actions/voice-campaign-actions.ts` (line 70-71)

## âœ… HOW THE AGENT PROMPT IS CREATED

### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **User Input** â†’ User answers 15+ setup questions
   
2. **AI Generation** â†’ Answers sent to OpenAI GPT-4 (`lib/ai-campaign-generator.ts`)
   - Function: `generateCampaignConfig(setupAnswers)`
   - Model: GPT-4 Turbo
   - Temperature: 0.8 (creative but consistent)

3. **AI Generates:**
   - **System Prompt** - Core instructions for the agent (personality, knowledge, goals)
   - **First Message** - Opening greeting based on campaign type
   - **Voicemail Message** - What to say if call goes to voicemail
   - **End Call Phrases** - Natural ways to end the call
   - **Objection Handlers** - Responses to common objections (optional)

4. **Provider Configuration** â†’ AI config sent to Vapi/Retell:
   - Vapi: Creates assistant with model, voice, transcriber, analysis plan
   - Retell: Creates agent with LLM config, voice, webhook

5. **Database Storage** â†’ Everything stored in `voice_campaigns` table:
   - Setup answers (JSONB)
   - AI-generated prompts
   - Provider IDs
   - Phone number
   - Webhook URL

## âœ… CURRENT VAPI CONFIGURATION

### What's Configured:
- **Model:** GPT-4 Turbo (OpenAI)
- **Voice Provider:** ElevenLabs
- **Voice Selection:** Auto-selected based on user's voice preference (male/female)
- **Transcriber:** Deepgram Nova-2 (English)
- **Server/Webhooks:** Configured with ngrok URL
- **Server Messages:** end-of-call-report, transcript, hang, status-update
- **Analysis Plan:**
  - Summary generation
  - Structured data extraction (based on `must_collect` fields)
  - Success evaluation (did agent achieve goal?)
  - Success rubric: NumericScale

### What's Hardcoded (Could Be Made Configurable):
- OpenAI model (currently "gpt-4-turbo", could add "gpt-3.5-turbo", "claude-3-opus")
- Voice provider (currently ElevenLabs, could add Cartesia, Azure, PlayHT)
- Transcriber provider (currently Deepgram, could add AssemblyAI, Google, OpenAI)
- Temperature (currently 0.7)

### Optional Future Enhancements:
If you want users to choose:
1. **Model Selection** - Add question: "Which AI model?" (GPT-4 more capable, GPT-3.5 cheaper)
2. **Voice Quality** - Add question: "Voice quality?" (ElevenLabs best, Cartesia faster)
3. **Advanced Data Schema** - Use Vapi's structured data JSON schema for strict validation

**Current system works great for 95% of use cases without these options.**
