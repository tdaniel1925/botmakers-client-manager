# Logo Upload Fix

## Problem
Logo was not saving to the database. All other branding settings (company name, address, colors, etc.) were saving correctly, but `logoUrl` remained empty.

## Root Cause
The user was selecting a file from the file picker but then clicking "Save Changes" button directly, which only saved the form state (which didn't include the uploaded logo URL yet). The user needed to click a separate "Upload" button first, but this was not obvious.

## Solution
Changed the logo upload to be **automatic** when a file is selected:

### What Changed:

1. **`handleLogoChange` function** - Now automatically uploads when file is selected:
   ```typescript
   const handleLogoChange = async (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
     const file = e.target.files?.[0];
     if (file) {
       // Show preview immediately
       setLogoFile(file);
       const reader = new FileReader();
       reader.onloadend = () => {
         setLogoPreview(reader.result as string);
       };
       reader.readAsDataURL(file);
       
       // ✨ Auto-upload to Vercel Blob
       toast.info('Uploading logo...');
       const formData = new FormData();
       formData.append('logo', file);
       
       const result = await uploadLogoAction(formData);
       
       if (result.success && result.url) {
         // Update form state with URL
         const updatedForm = { ...form, logoUrl: result.url };
         setForm(updatedForm);
         setLogoPreview(result.url);
         
         // Auto-save to database
         const saveResult = await updateBrandingAction(updatedForm);
         
         if (saveResult.success) {
           toast.success('Logo uploaded and saved successfully!');
           await loadBranding();
         }
       }
     }
   };
   ```

2. **Removed manual "Upload" button** - No longer needed

3. **Updated UI text** - Changed "Upload New Logo" to "Upload New Logo (Auto-saves)" with helpful hint

## User Experience Now:

1. **User clicks "Choose File"**
2. **User selects logo**
3. **✨ Automatic actions:**
   - Toast notification: "Uploading logo..."
   - Uploads to Vercel Blob
   - Saves URL to database
   - Shows preview
   - Toast notification: "Logo uploaded and saved successfully!"
4. **Done!** - Logo is saved and will appear in all emails

## Testing:

Visit `/platform/settings/branding`:
1. Click the file input
2. Select a logo image
3. You'll see:
   - "Uploading logo..." toast
   - Preview appears immediately
   - "Logo uploaded and saved successfully!" toast
4. Refresh the page - logo is still there
5. Click "Preview Email" - logo appears in email

## Files Changed:
- `app/platform/settings/branding/page.tsx`
  - Modified `handleLogoChange` to auto-upload
  - Removed `handleUploadLogo` function
  - Updated UI to remove Upload button
  - Added clear instructions about auto-save

## Result:
✅ Logo now uploads and saves automatically  
✅ Much simpler UX - no extra button clicks  
✅ Clear feedback with toast notifications  
✅ Consistent with other settings that save on change
