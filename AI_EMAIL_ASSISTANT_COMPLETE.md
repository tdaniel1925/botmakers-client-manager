- ✅ Automatic reset every 60 seconds

### Data Privacy
- ✅ No email data stored by OpenAI (zero data retention)
- ✅ Minimal data sent (only relevant context)
- ✅ Body text limited to 5000 characters
- ✅ Recent emails capped at 20 for efficiency

### Error Handling
- ✅ Graceful API failures
- ✅ User-friendly error messages

- Total context: **~3,000-5,000 tokens**
- Conversation history: **last 10 messages**

### Cost Optimization
- Smart context loading (only includes all emails when searching)
- Efficient system prompt (structured, not verbose)
- Message truncation for older conversations
- Rate limiting prevents runaway costs

### Speed
- Typical response time: **2-4 seconds**
- API calls run in parallel where possible
- Cached account/folder data (client-side)
- Streaming responses (future enhancement)

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Variables
Add to `.env.local`:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...your-key-here
```

### 2. OpenAI Account
1. Sign up at https://platform.openai.com
2. Generate API key
3. Add payment method (usage-based pricing)
4. Set usage limits (recommended: $50/month)

### 3. Cost Estimates
Based on GPT-4 Turbo pricing:
- **Average conversation:** ~5,000 tokens
- **Cost per conversation:** ~$0.05-0.10
- **100 conversations/day:** ~$5-10/day
- **Monthly (3,000 convos):** ~$150-300/month

For lower costs, can switch to GPT-3.5:
- Change model to `gpt-3.5-turbo`
- ~10x cheaper ($15-30/month for same usage)
- Slightly less capable but still very good

### 4. Testing

npm run dev

# Open email client
http://localhost:3001/platform/emails

# Click AI Copilot (right panel)
# Start asking questions!
```

## 🎓 Best Practices

### For Users
1. **Be specific** - "Summarize the email about Q4 budget" vs "Summarize"
2. **Use search keywords** - Include "all" or "search" for inbox-wide queries
3. **Reference email numbers** - "Summarize email #5" from the recent list
4. **Ask follow-ups** - AI remembers conversation context
5. **Iterate on drafts** - "Make it more formal" or "Add deadline mention"

### For Developers
1. **Monitor API usage** - Check OpenAI dashboard regularly
2. **Adjust rate limits** - Increase for power users, decrease for free tier
3. **Optimize context** - Only include necessary email data
4. **Cache responses** - For repeated queries (future enhancement)
5. **A/B test models** - GPT-4 vs GPT-3.5 for cost/quality balance
