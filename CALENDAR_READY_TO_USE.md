  name: "Work",
  color: "#3B82F6",
  type: "work"
})

// Get events

```

---

## 🎨 Customization

### Changing Calendar Colors

Colors are stored in the `calendars` table:

```sql
UPDATE calendars 
SET color = '#10B981'  -- Green
WHERE id = 'calendar-id';
```

Default colors:
- Blue: `#3B82F6`
- Green: `#10B981`
- Red: `#EF4444`
- Purple: `#8B5CF6`
- Orange: `#F59E0B`

### Changing Default View

Set in `calendar_settings`:

```typescript
await updateCalendarSettingsAction({
  defaultView: 'week'  // 'day', 'week', or 'month'
})
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Events Not Showing?

1. Check calendar is visible (checkbox in sidebar)
2. Verify date range (navigate to correct month/week)
3. Check browser console for errors

### Can't Create Events?

1. Ensure at least one calendar exists
2. Check all required fields are filled
3. Verify start time is before end time

### Sync Not Working?

1. Confirm Nylas API key is set
2. Check email account has `nylasGrantId`
3. Look for sync errors in server logs
