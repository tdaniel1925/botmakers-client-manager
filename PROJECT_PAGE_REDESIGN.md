# Project Page Redesign Summary

## Changes Made

### ✅ Fixed Button Overflow Issues
**Before:** Buttons were running off the page on smaller screens  
**After:** Responsive button layout that adapts to screen size

### ✅ Improved Header Layout
- **Mobile:** Buttons stack vertically, full width for easy tapping
- **Tablet/Desktop:** Compact inline buttons with icons
- **Secondary actions:** Moved to dropdown menu (Webhooks, Workflows, Templates)
- **Primary actions:** Visible as buttons (Calls, Campaigns)

### ✅ Better Symmetry
- Call Analytics and Voice Campaigns now displayed side-by-side in a 2-column grid
- Cards have equal heights for balanced appearance
- Consistent spacing throughout

### ✅ Voice Campaign Widget Improvements
- "Create First Campaign" button properly sized and centered
- Button limited to max-width (doesn't stretch too wide)
- Card stretches to full height for consistent alignment
- Better text wrapping and truncation for long campaign names

## Test Recommendations

   - Check that all buttons are easily tappable
   - Ensure text doesn't overflow

2. **Test on Desktop:**
   - Verify 2-column layout for widgets
   - Check dropdown menu works correctly
   - Ensure equal card heights

3. **Test Voice Campaigns Widget:**
   - Empty state: "Create First Campaign" button looks good
   - Active campaigns: Cards display properly
   - Phone numbers truncate correctly
