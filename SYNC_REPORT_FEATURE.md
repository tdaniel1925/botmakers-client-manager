## 🔢 Understanding the Numbers

### "Total in Account"
- Emails that exist in your email provider (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
- This is the source of truth
- **Note**: Count is estimated for large folders (>1000 emails)

### "Synced to Client"
- Emails downloaded and stored in local database
- Available for offline access
- Searchable and accessible instantly

### "Unsynced Emails"
- Difference between account and client
- Emails not yet downloaded
- May include:
  - New emails since last sync
  - Emails skipped during previous sync
  - Emails from folders not yet synced

### Sync Percentage
```
Calculation: (Synced / Total in Account) × 100

Examples:
- 9,847 / 10,524 = 93.6% ≈ 94%
- 10,000 / 10,000 = 100% ✅ Fully Synced
```

## 🔍 Technical Details

### How It Works

**1. Fetching Account Data**:
```typescript
// Connects to email provider (Nylas)
// Counts emails in each folder
// Returns total count
```

**2. Fetching Local Data**:
```typescript
// Queries local database
// Counts emails per folder
// Returns synced count
```

**3. Calculating Difference**:
```typescript
unsynced = totalInAccount - totalInDatabase
syncPercentage = (totalInDatabase / totalInAccount) × 100
```

### Performance

**Report Generation**:
- Database queries: ~50-200ms
- API calls to provider: ~1-3 seconds
- Total time: ~2-5 seconds

**Optimizations**:
- Parallel queries (folders fetched simultaneously)
- Caching (report data stored in memory)
- Efficient counting (SQL COUNT queries)

### Accuracy

**Exact Counts**:
- ✅ Synced emails (database): 100% accurate
- ✅ Last sync date: Exact timestamp

**Estimated Counts**:
- ⚠️ Total in account: Estimated for folders >1000 emails
- Reason: Email providers don't return exact counts
- Estimation method: Conservative (may underestimate)
- Accuracy: ±5% for large folders

## 📊 Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Fully Synced Account
```
Total in Account:    10,000
Synced to Client:    10,000
Unsynced:                 0
Sync Percentage:       100%
Status:            ✅ Fully Synced
```
**What this means**: All emails downloaded, nothing missing!

### Example 2: Partial Sync
```
Total in Account:    15,234
Synced to Client:    12,109
Unsynced:             3,125
Sync Percentage:        79%
Status:            ⚠️ Partial Sync
```
**What this means**: 3,125 emails not yet synced. Click "Sync Missing Emails".

### Example 3: Initial Setup
```
Total in Account:    50,000
Synced to Client:       847
Unsynced:            49,153
Sync Percentage:         2%
Status:            🔄 Syncing...
```
**What this means**: Just started sync. Wait for completion, then check report again.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Email Count Estimates
- For folders with >1000 emails, count is estimated
- Email providers (Gmail, Outlook) don't provide exact counts
- Our estimate is conservative (may show slightly fewer)
- **This is normal and doesn't affect actual emails**

### Sync Process
- "Sync Missing Emails" downloads ALL unsynced emails
- This may take time for large gaps (5-10 minutes)
- Sync continues even if you close the modal
- You can use the email client while syncing

### Folder Sync
- Some folders sync automatically (INBOX, SENT)
- Custom folders may need manual sync
- Use "Sync Folders" button first, then check report

### Duplicate Protection
- Sync is idempotent (safe to run multiple times)
- Already-synced emails are skipped
- No duplicates created
- Only missing emails are downloaded

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Failed to Generate Report"
**Possible causes**:
- No internet connection
- Email account disconnected
- API rate limit reached

**Solutions**:
1. Check internet connection
2. Try "Refresh Report"
3. Reconnect email account if needed
4. Wait a minute and try again

### Large Unsynced Count
**Possible causes**:
- Initial setup not complete
- Sync was interrupted
- New emails since last sync
- Folders not yet synced

**Solutions**:
1. Click "Sync Missing Emails"
2. Let sync complete (may take 5-10 minutes)
3. Check folder breakdown for specifics
4. Run "Sync Folders" if needed

### Sync Percentage Stuck
**Possible causes**:
- Sync in progress
- Network issues
- Large email volume

**Solutions**:
1. Wait for current sync to complete
2. Check sync progress modal
3. Refresh report after sync completes
4. Try manual sync if stuck
