# Voice Campaign SaaS Billing Implementation

## ðŸŽ‰ Implementation Complete!

A comprehensive multi-payment provider SaaS billing system has been successfully implemented for your AI Voice Campaign platform.

## âœ… What Was Built

### 1. Database Schema (`db/schema/billing-schema.ts`)
- **Subscription Plans** table with included minutes, overage rates, and provider-specific IDs
- **Organization Subscriptions** table tracking billing cycles and usage
- **Usage Records** table for detailed call-by-call billing audit trail
- **Invoices** table for monthly billing records

### 2. Default Subscription Plans
Four tiers ready to use:
- **Free**: $0/mo, 100 minutes, $0.15/min overage, 1 campaign
- **Starter**: $99/mo, 1,000 minutes, $0.10/min overage, 5 campaigns
- **Professional**: $299/mo, 5,000 minutes, $0.08/min overage, unlimited campaigns
- **Enterprise**: $999/mo, 20,000 minutes, $0.06/min overage, unlimited everything

### 3. Payment Provider Integrations
- **Stripe** (fully implemented with metered billing)
- **Square** (stub implementation)
- **PayPal** (stub implementation)
- Provider factory for easy switching

### 4. Real-Time Usage Tracking
- Automatic minute tracking on every call
- Overage detection and cost calculation
- Usage remaining checks before campaign creation
- Detailed audit trail in usage_records table

### 5. Billing Webhooks
- Stripe webhook handler for subscription lifecycle events
- Automatic status updates on payment success/failure
- Invoice generation on successful payments

### 6. Campaign Creation Guards
- Subscription requirement check
- Campaign limit enforcement based on plan
- Usage status validation
- Graceful error messages with upgrade prompts

### 7. Call Usage Integration
- Automatic usage recording when calls complete
- Organization-level billing through projects
- Non-blocking error handling

### 8. Billing Cycle Automation
- Automated 30-day billing cycle resets
- Invoice generation at period end
- Overage reporting to payment providers
- Usage counter resets for new periods

### 9. Migration Tools
- Script to assign existing orgs to Free tier
- Seed script for subscription plans

### 10. UI Components
- Usage meter with progress bars and warnings
- Plan selector with feature comparison
- Subscription management actions

## ðŸ“‹ Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Migration

First, push the new schema to your database:

```bash
cd codespring-boilerplate
npx drizzle-kit push
```

### 2. Seed Subscription Plans

```bash
npx tsx db/seed-plans.ts
```

Expected output:
```
ðŸŒ± Seeding subscription plans...
  âœ… Created plan: Free ($0/month)
  âœ… Created plan: Starter ($99/month)
  âœ… Created plan: Professional ($299/month)
  âœ… Created plan: Enterprise ($999/month)
âœ… Subscription plans seeded successfully!
```

### 3. Migrate Existing Organizations

```bash
npx tsx scripts/migrate-orgs-to-free-tier.ts
```

This assigns all existing organizations to the Free plan.

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Add to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Stripe (Required for billing)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...

# Square (Optional)
SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN=
SQUARE_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox
SQUARE_WEBHOOK_SIGNATURE_KEY=

# PayPal (Optional)
PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=
PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET=
PAYPAL_WEBHOOK_ID=
PAYPAL_MODE=sandbox
```

### 5. Configure Stripe Products

In your Stripe Dashboard, create products for each plan and update `subscription_plans` table with the Stripe price IDs:

```sql
UPDATE subscription_plans 
SET stripe_product_id = 'prod_xxx',
    stripe_price_id = 'price_xxx',
    stripe_metered_price_id = 'price_xxx_metered'
WHERE slug = 'starter';
```

Or use the Stripe provider's helper method:

```typescript
import { getPaymentProvider } from "@/lib/payment-providers/provider-factory";

const stripe = getPaymentProvider("stripe");
const { basePriceId, meteredPriceId } = await stripe.createPricesForPlan(
  "prod_xxx", // Stripe product ID
  9900,       // $99.00 in cents
  10          // $0.10/min in cents
);
```

### 6. Set Up Stripe Webhooks

In Stripe Dashboard â†’ Webhooks, add endpoint:
- **URL**: `https://yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/stripe-billing`
- **Events**: 
  - `customer.subscription.created`
  - `customer.subscription.updated`
  - `customer.subscription.deleted`
  - `invoice.payment_succeeded`
  - `invoice.payment_failed`

### 7. Schedule Billing Cycle Reset

Set up a daily cron job to run:

```bash
npx tsx lib/cron/billing-cycle-reset.ts
```

Or use a service like Vercel Cron, AWS EventBridge, or a dedicated cron job service.

## ðŸ”§ How It Works

### When a User Creates a Campaign

1. System checks if organization has active subscription
2. Validates they haven't exceeded campaign limits
3. Checks if subscription status is active (not past_due)
4. If all pass, campaign is created
5. If fails, shows appropriate error with upgrade/subscription prompt

### When a Call Completes

1. Webhook receives call completion event
2. System finds the campaign via webhook ID
3. Gets organization from project association
4. Calculates minutes used (rounds up)
5. Records usage in `usage_records` table
6. Updates subscription's `minutesUsedThisCycle`
7. If overage, calculates cost and updates `overageCostThisCycle`
8. Returns usage status with remaining minutes

### Monthly Billing Cycle

1. Cron job runs daily checking for subscriptions with `currentPeriodEnd < now()`
2. For each subscription:
   - Generates invoice with subscription fee + overage charges
   - Reports overage usage to payment provider (Stripe metered billing)
   - Resets usage counters to 0
   - Sets new period dates (current end + 30 days)
3. Payment provider automatically charges customer
4. Webhook receives payment confirmation
5. Invoice marked as paid

## ðŸŽ¨ UI Integration

### Display Usage Meter

```tsx
import { UsageMeter } from "@/components/billing/usage-meter";
import { getOrganizationSubscriptionAction } from "@/actions/subscription-actions";

export default async function DashboardPage() {
  const { usage } = await getOrganizationSubscriptionAction(organizationId);
  
  if (!usage) return <div>No subscription</div>;
  
  return (
    <UsageMeter
      minutesUsed={usage.usage.minutesUsed}
      minutesIncluded={usage.usage.minutesIncluded}
      overageMinutes={usage.usage.overageMinutes}
      overageCost={usage.usage.overageCost}
      percentageUsed={usage.usage.percentageUsed}
    />
  );
}
```

### Display Plan Selector

```tsx
import { PlanSelector } from "@/components/billing/plan-selector";
import { getAvailablePlansAction } from "@/actions/subscription-actions";

export default async function PricingPage() {
  const { plans } = await getAvailablePlansAction();
  
  return (
    <PlanSelector
      plans={plans}
      currentPlanSlug="free"
      onSelectPlan={(plan) => {
        // Handle plan selection
        // Redirect to Stripe checkout or show payment modal
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

## ðŸ“Š Database Queries

### Get Organization Usage
```typescript
import { getOrganizationUsageStats } from "@/db/queries/billing-queries";

const stats = await getOrganizationUsageStats(organizationId);
console.log(`Used ${stats.usage.minutesUsed} of ${stats.usage.minutesIncluded} minutes`);
console.log(`${stats.usage.percentageUsed}% used`);
```

### Check if User Can Make Calls
```typescript
import { checkUsageLimit } from "@/lib/billing/usage-tracker";

const status = await checkUsageLimit(organizationId);
if (!status.canMakeCalls) {
  return "Subscription inactive - please update payment method";
}
```

## ðŸ”’ Security Notes

- All subscription actions require platform admin role
- Webhook signatures are verified before processing
- API keys validated on webhook endpoints
- Usage recording failures don't block call webhooks
- Provider sync errors don't fail database updates

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

1. **Create Billing Dashboard Page** at `/platform/organizations/[id]/billing`
2. **Implement Stripe Checkout** for plan purchases
3. **Add Email Notifications** for:
   - Payment failures
   - Usage warnings (75%, 90% thresholds)
   - Billing cycle renewals
4. **Build Admin Panel** for managing plans and viewing analytics
5. **Complete Square/PayPal Implementations** if needed
6. **Add Usage Analytics Dashboard** with charts
7. **Implement Plan Upgrade/Downgrade** flows
8. **Add Payment Method Management** UI
