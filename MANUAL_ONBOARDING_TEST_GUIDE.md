## üß™ **TEST 4: Convert Abandoned Session**

**Goal:** Client starts onboarding, abandons it, admin converts to manual and completes

### Step-by-Step

**4.1 Create Client-Started Session**
```
Option A (Quick - Modify Database):
1. Create a regular client onboarding session
2. Manually update in database:
   UPDATE client_onboarding_sessions 
   SET 
     status = 'in_progress',
     updated_at = NOW() - INTERVAL '8 days'
   WHERE id = '[session_id]';

Option B (Real Flow):
1. Create project with "Send invitation to client" mode
2. As client, start onboarding via email link
3. Fill 1-2 sections only
4. Abandon (don't complete)
5. Wait (or manually update updated_at to 8 days ago)
```

**4.2 Identify Abandoned Session**
```
1. Navigate to: http://localhost:3000/platform/onboarding
2. Look for session with:
   - Status: "In Progress"
   - Completion mode: "Client"
   - "Abandoned" badge (red, 7+ days inactive)
```

**4.3 Convert to Manual**
```
1. Find abandoned session in list
2. Click actions dropdown (‚ãÆ)
3. Click "Convert to Manual"
4. Confirm in dialog: "Convert & Continue"
```

**Expected:** 
- Success toast: "Session converted to manual onboarding"
- Redirected to manual onboarding form
- Client's partial responses preserved in form

**4.4 Continue from Client's Progress**
```
1. Verify form shows:
   - Sections client filled: Already have data (preserved)
   - Sections client didn't fill: Empty, ready for admin
2. Fill remaining sections
3. Toggle "Finalize now" ON
4. Click "Finalize Onboarding"
```

**4.5 Verify Mixed Attribution**
```
1. Go to session details
2. Check completion mode: Should show "Manual (Admin Filled)" or "Hybrid"
3. Look for attribution indicators:
   - Early sections: Completed by client (before abandonment)
   - Later sections: Completed by admin (after conversion)
```

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ Client's partial data preserved
- ‚úÖ Admin completed remaining sections
- ‚úÖ Completion mode changed from 'client' to 'manual'
- ‚úÖ Attribution shows mixed (client early, admin later)
- ‚úÖ Session marked as completed
- ‚úÖ No data loss
