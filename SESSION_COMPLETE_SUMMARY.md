## 🛡️ Self-Healing Integration

All server actions are protected with automatic error recovery:

### **Recovery Strategies:**
- Database connection failures → Auto-retry with backoff
- Network timeouts → Exponential backoff
- Validation errors → Safe defaults
- Transient errors → Multiple recovery attempts

### **Monitoring:**
- All healing events logged to database
- Visible in System Health dashboard (`/platform/system-health`)
- Admin alerts for critical failures
- Pattern learning for improved recovery over time

---

## 🔐 Authorization

### **Role-Based Access:**
- **Admin** → Full CRUD (create, read, update, delete)
- **Member** → Create, read, update
- **Viewer** → Read-only

### **Security:**
- All actions protected by Clerk authentication
- Contact ownership verified on all operations
- Delete operations require admin role
- Organization membership checked

---

## 📱 User Experience

### **Beautiful UI:**
- Modern card-based layout
- Responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Professional appearance

### **Smart Features:**
- Organization selector
- Real-time search
- Clickable email/phone links (mailto:, tel:)
- Primary contact badges
- Loading states
- Empty states with helpful messages
- Success/error toast notifications

### **Efficient Workflow:**
- Single-click actions
- Comprehensive forms
- Auto-validation
- Instant feedback

├── organization_id     UUID → organizations
├── first_name          TEXT (required)
├── last_name           TEXT (required)
├── full_name           TEXT (auto-generated: first + last)
├── job_title           TEXT

## 🎯 Key Design Decisions

### **1. UUID Types**
- Consistent with existing organizations table
- Auto-generated by database
- Better for distributed systems

### **2. Soft Delete**
- Contacts never permanently deleted
- Set `is_active = false` to archive
- Preserves historical data

### **3. Primary Contact Logic**
- Only ONE primary per organization
- Auto-toggle: setting new primary unsets old one
- Enforced at query level for data integrity

### **4. Generated Full Name**
- Database automatically combines first + last
- Always in sync
- Indexed for fast search

---

## 🔄 What This System Is (and Isn't)

### ✅ **What It IS:**
- Simple contact directory for organizations
- Professional address book
- Organization-level contacts
- Name, phone, email, address storage

### ❌ **What It's NOT:**
- NOT a sales CRM (no pipelines)
- NOT for deal tracking (no stages)
- NOT for workflows (no automation)
- NOT project-specific (that's separate)

### **Analogy:**
> "Think of it as your phone's contact list - but for each organization in your system."
