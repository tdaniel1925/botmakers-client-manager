## 📬 How It Works Now

### When Syncing 4,000 Emails:

**Recent Emails (< 2 weeks old) - Example: 300 emails**
```
Email from 3 days ago
   ↓
screeningStatus = 'pending'
   ↓
Goes to Screener for manual review ✅
```

**Old Emails (> 2 weeks old) - Example: 3,700 emails**
```
Email from 45 days ago
   ↓
Auto-classify triggered!
   ↓
Check: Is it a newsletter/bulk email?
   ↓
   YES (2,500 emails) → The Feed 📰
   ↓
Check: Is it a receipt/invoice?
   ↓
   YES (800 emails) → Paper Trail 🧾
   ↓
Everything else (400 emails) → Imbox ✨
   ↓
screeningStatus = 'auto_classified'
   ↓
Skip Screener! ✅
```

## 🎯 Results

### For 4,000 Emails:

**Before (Without Improvements):**
```
Screener: 4,000 emails to review manually 😰
Imbox: 0 emails
Feed: 0 emails
Paper Trail: 0 emails
```

**After (With Smart Classifier):**
```
Screener: ~300 recent emails (last 2 weeks) ✅
Imbox: ~400 important emails ✅
The Feed: ~2,500 newsletters/bulk ✅
Paper Trail: ~800 receipts/invoices ✅
```

**You only manually screen 300 instead of 4,000!** 🎉

## 💡 Why This Works Better

### Enhanced Header Detection:

Many bulk emails have standard headers that the old classifier ignored:
- `List-Unsubscribe` header → Clear bulk mail indicator
- `Precedence: bulk` → Email marked as bulk
- `X-Campaign-Id` → From marketing platform

Now we check these headers for **100% accuracy** on properly-tagged bulk emails!

### Expanded Pattern Matching:

More sender patterns detected:
- team@, hi@, hey@, mail@ (common bulk senders)
- Marketing platform detection (sendgrid, mailchimp, etc.)
- More promotional keywords

### Smart Default:

Only emails that truly don't fit any category go to Imbox:
- Personal emails from real people
- Important business communications
- Unique/important emails
