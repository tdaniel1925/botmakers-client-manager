## Required Setup

### 1. Install Packages (Already Done)
```bash
npm install uploadthing @uploadthing/react
```

### 2. Get Uploadthing API Keys

1. Sign up at [uploadthing.com](https://uploadthing.com)
2. Create a new app
3. Copy your App ID and Secret Key

### 3. Add Environment Variables

Add to your `.env.local`:

```bash
UPLOADTHING_SECRET="sk_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxx"
UPLOADTHING_APP_ID="your_app_id_here"
```

### 4. Restart Dev Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

---

## How It Works Now

### Authenticated Uploads
For logged-in users uploading files:

```typescript
// Uses Clerk authentication automatically
const { startUpload } = useUploadThing("authenticatedUpload");
await startUpload(files);
```

### Public Onboarding Uploads
For public onboarding forms (token-based):

```typescript
// Uses token parameter for authentication
const { startUpload } = useUploadThing("onboardingUpload");
await startUpload(files, { url: `/api/uploadthing?token=${token}` });
```

### FileUpload Component
The existing `<FileUpload>` component API remains the same:

```tsx
<FileUpload
  organizationId={orgId}
  category="logos"
  multiple={true}
  maxSize={16}
  onUploadComplete={(files) => console.log(files)}
  // For public uploads:
  publicToken={token}
  usePublicUpload={true}
/>
```

|---------|-------------|------------------|
| **Setup Complexity** | ‚≠ê Simple | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Complex |
| **CDN Included** | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No |
| **Type Safety** | ‚úÖ Full | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial |
| **Error Handling** | ‚úÖ Built-in | üîß Manual |
| **Progress Tracking** | ‚úÖ Built-in | üîß Manual |
| **Free Tier** | 2GB + 10GB bandwidth | 1GB storage |
| **Pricing** | $20/mo for 100GB | $25/mo for 100GB |
| **RLS Setup** | ‚ùå Not needed | ‚úÖ Required |
| **Bucket Config** | ‚ùå Not needed | ‚úÖ Required |

### Key Advantages

1. **Zero Configuration** - No buckets, no RLS policies, no CORS setup
2. **Built-in CDN** - Fast file delivery worldwide
3. **Better DX** - Type-safe, hooks-based API
4. **Automatic Retries** - Built-in error recovery
5. **Progress Tracking** - Real-time upload progress
6. **Cost Effective** - Better pricing for most use cases

---

## Compatibility

### Existing Components
All existing components continue to work:
- ‚úÖ `<FileUpload>` component
- ‚úÖ `onUploadComplete` callbacks
- ‚úÖ File data structure unchanged
- ‚úÖ Progress tracking maintained

### Database
No database changes needed:
- File URLs stored the same way
- Same response data structure
- Existing uploads remain accessible

### Onboarding System
Fully compatible:
- Token-based authentication works
- File uploads in onboarding wizard
- Admin responses viewer displays files

---

## Testing

### Automated Tests
Run the comprehensive test suite:

```
http://localhost:3000/test/auto-test-uploads
```

This will:
1. Create a test onboarding session
2. Inject mock file upload data
3. Verify files are saved correctly
4. Validate file URLs and structure

### Manual Testing

1. **Test Onboarding Upload:**
   - Create project ‚Üí Generate onboarding link
   - Open link in incognito window
   - Upload files in upload step
   - Verify files display in admin view

2. **Test Authenticated Upload:**
   - Go to `/test/upload`
   - Select organization
   - Upload test files
   - Verify success messages

## Rollback Plan

If needed, you can rollback by:
