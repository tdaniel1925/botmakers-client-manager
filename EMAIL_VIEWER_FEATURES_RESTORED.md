## 🔍 Technical Details

### **Implementation:**

**Each Hey View Now Checks:**
```typescript
// Show EmailViewer if an email is selected
if (selectedEmail) {
  return (
    <div className="h-full flex flex-col">
      {/* Back button header */}
      <div className="border-b bg-background p-3">
        <Button onClick={() => onEmailClick(null)}>
          ← Back to Imbox
        </Button>
      </div>
      
      {/* Email Viewer */}
      <div className="flex-1 overflow-auto">
        <EmailViewer
          email={selectedEmail}
          onClose={() => onEmailClick(null)}
        />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

// Otherwise show email list
return ( /* email cards */ );
```

**AI Popup:**
- Still controlled via `isPopupActive` prop
