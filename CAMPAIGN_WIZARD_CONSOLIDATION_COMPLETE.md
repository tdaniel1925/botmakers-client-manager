# Campaign Wizard Consolidation - Implementation Complete âœ…

**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Version:** 1.0

## ðŸ“‹ Overview

Successfully consolidated the campaign creation wizard by replacing the separate "Schedule" step with a comprehensive **"Contacts, Schedule and Follow-Up"** step that includes contact management, SMS automation, and email automation in one unified interface.

---

## âœ… What Was Completed

### 1. **Campaign Type Simplification**
- âœ… Confirmed that both AI wizard and manual form only offer "Inbound" OR "Outbound" (no "both" option)
- âœ… Campaign type selection is clear and mutually exclusive

### 2. **New ContactsScheduleConfig Component**
**File:** `components/voice-campaigns/contacts-schedule-config.tsx`

Created a comprehensive component with 5 integrated sections:

#### Section 1: Contact Management (Always visible)
- Contact list upload using existing `ContactListUpload` component
- Contact preview and management
- Upload status indicator

#### Section 2: Outbound Schedule (Only for outbound campaigns)
- Call days and windows configuration
- Max attempts and retry intervals
- Timezone respect toggle
- Integrates existing `ScheduleConfigForm` component

#### Section 3: SMS Automation (Always visible)
- **Follow-ups to contacts:**
  - Enable/disable toggle
  - Template editor with variables: `{contact_name}`, `{agent_name}`, `{call_summary}`, `{company_name}`
- **Notifications to owner:**
  - Enable/disable toggle
  - Template editor
  - Trigger selection: all calls, qualified leads only, failed calls

#### Section 4: Email Automation (Always visible)
- **Follow-ups to contacts:**
  - Enable/disable toggle
  - Subject line editor
  - Body template with variables
- **Notifications to owner:**
  - Enable/disable toggle
  - Frequency selector: real-time, daily digest, weekly summary

#### Section 5: Save Options
- "Save Draft & Continue Later" button
- Auto-save indicator
- Integrates with existing wizard storage system

### 3. **Manual Wizard Updates**
**File:** `components/voice-campaigns/campaign-wizard.tsx`

- âœ… Updated `WizardStep` type: `"schedule"` â†’ `"contacts-schedule"`
- âœ… Replaced `scheduleConfig` state with `contactsScheduleConfig` (includes contacts, SMS, email settings)
- âœ… Updated step sequence and labels
- âœ… Simplified navigation logic (removed complex step skipping)
- âœ… Updated `handleGenerateCampaign` to include all new settings in campaign creation
- âœ… Integrated ContactsScheduleConfig component with save draft functionality

### 4. **AI Wizard Updates**
**File:** `components/voice-campaigns/ai-campaign-wizard.tsx`

- âœ… Updated `WizardStep` type: `"schedule"` â†’ `"contacts-schedule"`
- âœ… Replaced `scheduleConfig` state with `contactsScheduleConfig`
- âœ… Renamed `handleContinueToSchedule` â†’ `handleContinueToContactsSchedule`
- âœ… Replaced `renderScheduleStep` with `renderContactsScheduleStep`
- âœ… Updated campaign payload to include contacts, SMS settings, and email settings
- âœ… All campaigns (inbound and outbound) now go through contacts-schedule step

### 5. **Database Schema Updates**
**File:** `db/schema/voice-campaigns-schema.ts`

Added two new JSONB columns to `voice_campaigns` table:

```typescript
// SMS Automation Settings
smsSettings: jsonb("sms_settings")
/* Structure:
{
  followUps: {
    enabled: boolean,
    template: string
  },
  notifications: {
    enabled: boolean,
    template: string,
    triggers: ['all_calls' | 'qualified_leads' | 'failed_calls']
  }
}
*/

// Email Automation Settings
emailSettings: jsonb("email_settings")
/* Structure:
{
  followUps: {
    enabled: boolean,
    subject: string,
    body: string
  },
  notifications: {
    enabled: boolean,
    frequency: 'realtime' | 'daily' | 'weekly'
  }
}
*/
```

**Migration:** `db/migrations/0042_add_automation_settings.sql`
- âœ… Created and applied successfully
- âœ… Includes column comments for documentation

### 6. **Preview Step Updates**
**File:** `components/voice-campaigns/campaign-preview-step.tsx`

Enhanced the preview step to display:

- âœ… **Contact List Summary:** Shows count of uploaded contacts
- âœ… **SMS Automation Status:** 
  - Follow-ups enabled/disabled
  - Notifications enabled/disabled
  - Notification triggers (if enabled)
- âœ… **Email Automation Status:**
  - Follow-ups enabled/disabled
  - Notifications enabled/disabled
  - Notification frequency (if enabled)
- âœ… **Schedule Summary:** Only shown for outbound campaigns
- âœ… Backward compatibility with legacy `scheduleConfig` prop

### 7. **Save/Resume Functionality**
**File:** `lib/wizard-storage.ts` (existing)

- âœ… Already implemented and working
- âœ… Integrated into ContactsScheduleConfig component
- âœ… "Save Draft" button saves progress via `saveWizardProgress()`
- âœ… Auto-save on step changes
- âœ… 7-day expiry for saved progress

## ðŸŽ¨ User Experience Improvements

### Before:
- Separate "Schedule" step only for outbound campaigns
- No built-in SMS/email automation
- Step skipping logic was complex
- No unified contact management

### After:

- All campaigns go through same flow (sections show/hide based on type)
- SMS and email automation built-in and optional
- Contact upload, schedule, and automation in one place
- Cleaner, more intuitive flow

## ðŸ“Š Technical Benefits

1. **Simplified Logic:** No more complex step skipping based on campaign type
2. **Better Data Model:** All automation settings stored in structured JSONB fields
3. **Reusability:** ContactsScheduleConfig component is modular and testable
4. **Consistency:** Both AI and manual wizards use the same component
5. **Future-Proof:** Easy to add more automation types (e.g., webhooks, integrations)
6. **Type Safety:** Full TypeScript types for all settings
