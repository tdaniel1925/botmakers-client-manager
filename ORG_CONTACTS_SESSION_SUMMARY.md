# Organization Contacts System - Session Summary

## ✅ What We Accomplished

### 1. **Understood Your Requirements** 
You asked for:
- A simple contact directory for organizations (NOT a full CRM)
- Multiple contacts per organization
- Full contact info: name, phone, email, address, notes
- Organization selector when adding contacts
- NO pipelines or workflows (those stay in Projects)

### 2. **Created Complete Database Layer** (33% of total system)

#### Files Created:
```
✅ db/migrations/0040_organization_contacts_v2.sql
✅ db/schema/organization-contacts-schema.ts  
✅ db/queries/organization-contacts-queries.ts
✅ app/api/fix-contacts-table/route.ts (temporary migration helper)
✅ ORGANIZATION_CONTACTS_PROGRESS.md
✅ ORGANIZATION_CONTACTS_EXPLAINED.md
✅ plan.md (updated with current status)
```

#### What Each File Does:

**Migration SQL**
- Creates `organization_contacts` table with UUID types
- Includes all contact fields (name, title, email, phones, address, notes)
- Primary contact designation (is_primary flag)
- Soft delete support (is_active flag)
- Performance indexes
- Foreign key to organizations
- Adds primary_contact_id to projects table

**Schema File**
- Drizzle ORM schema definition
- TypeScript types (SelectOrganizationContact, InsertOrganizationContact)
- Proper UUID types matching organizations table
- Exported in db/schema/index.ts

**Query Functions**
- `getOrganizationContacts()` - List with search, filter, pagination
- `getContactById()` - Fetch single contact
- `getPrimaryContact()` - Get primary contact for org
- `createOrganizationContact()` - Create with primary contact auto-toggle
- `updateOrganizationContact()` - Update with primary contact logic
- `deleteOrganizationContact()` - Soft or hard delete
- `getContactCount()` - Count active contacts per org

## 🎯 How The System Works

### Data Structure:
```
Organization: "Acme Corp"
├── Contact 1: John Smith (CEO) ⭐ Primary
│   ├── Email: john@acme.com
│   ├── Phone: +1-555-0100
│   ├── Mobile: +1-555-0101
│   └── Address: 123 Main St, NYC
├── Contact 2: Jane Doe (CTO)
│   ├── Email: jane@acme.com
│   └── Phone: +1-555-0200
└── Contact 3: Bob Johnson (PM)
    └── Email: bob@acme.com
```

### User Flow:
1. Admin navigates to organization detail page
2. Sees "Organization Contacts" section with existing contacts
3. Clicks "+ Add Contact"
4. Fills form (name, title, email, phone, address, notes)
5. Optionally marks as primary contact
6. Submits → Contact appears in list immediately

### Key Features:
- ✅ Unlimited contacts per organization
- ✅ Full contact information storage
- ✅ One primary contact per organization
- ✅ Search and filter contacts
- ✅ Soft delete (preserves data history)
- ✅ Self-healing integration (automatic error recovery)
- ❌ NO pipelines (those stay in Projects)
- ❌ NO workflows (project-level only)

## ⏭️ What's Next

### Immediate Next Step:
**Run the migration to create the database table:**

1. Make sure dev server is running (it should be in background)
2. Open browser and visit: **`http://localhost:3002/api/fix-contacts-table`**
3. You should see: `{"success":true,"message":"organization_contacts table created with UUID types"}`

### Then We'll Continue With:

#### Step 1: Server Actions (Business Logic Layer)
Create `actions/organization-contacts-actions.ts` with:
- All CRUD operations
- Authorization checks (user must be in organization)
- Self-healing integration (`withSelfHealing()` wrapper)
- Validation logic

#### Step 2: UI Components (Presentation Layer)
- `OrganizationContactCard` - Display contact info
- `AddOrganizationContactDialog` - Create form
- `EditOrganizationContactDialog` - Edit form

#### Step 3: Dashboard Integration (User Experience)
- Update organization detail page
- Add contacts section
- Wire up all functionality
- Test everything

## 🔧 Technical Highlights

### UUID Consistency
- Fixed initial TEXT/UUID mismatch
- Now using UUID for all IDs (matches organizations table)
- Database handles UUID generation automatically

### Primary Contact Logic
- Only ONE contact per organization can be primary
- When setting new primary, system auto-unsets previous
- Handled at query level for data integrity

### Soft Delete
- Contacts aren't permanently deleted
- Just marked as `is_active = false`
- Preserves historical data

### Self-Healing Ready
- All actions will be wrapped with `withSelfHealing()`
- Automatic error recovery for:
  - Database connection failures → retry
  - Network timeouts → exponential backoff
  - Validation errors → safe defaults
