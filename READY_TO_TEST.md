## 🐛 If Something Doesn't Work

### Issue: Can't see Hey views
**Fix**: Wait 5 seconds for dev server to fully start, then refresh browser

### Issue: Keyboard shortcuts not working
**Fix**: Click somewhere in the app first (focus needs to be on the page)

### Issue: Mode dialog not showing
**Fix**: Clear localStorage: Open browser console and type:
```javascript
localStorage.removeItem('email_mode_set')
```
Then refresh.

### Issue: API errors
**Fix**: Check terminal for errors. API endpoint is at:
```
app/api/user/email-preferences/route.ts
```
