# Email Sync Features - Complete Implementation

## 🎉 Features Implemented

### 1. **Download ALL Emails** (Full Sync with Pagination)
- ✅ Automatically fetches ALL emails from your account (not just 50)
- ✅ Uses pagination to handle thousands of emails
- ✅ Shows progress in real-time: `Page 1`, `Page 2`, etc.
- ✅ Stops only when all emails are fetched

**How it works:**
```
📧 Page 1: Fetched 50 emails (Total: 50)
📧 Page 2: Fetched 50 emails (Total: 100)
📧 Page 3: Fetched 50 emails (Total: 150)
...
🎉 Sync Complete: { totalPages: 10, totalFetched: 487, synced: 437, skipped: 50, errors: 0 }
```

### 2. **Sync All Folders** from Email Account
- ✅ Fetches all folders/labels from your email provider
- ✅ Identifies folder types: Inbox, Sent, Trash, Drafts, Custom
- ✅ Shows unread count and total count for each folder
- ✅ Ready for future folder-based filtering

**Sample Output:**
```
📁 Nylas Folders: {
  count: 8,
  folders: [
    { id: 'inbox', name: 'Inbox', type: 'inbox', unreadCount: 45 },
    { id: 'sent', name: 'Sent', type: 'sent', unreadCount: 0 },
    { id: 'drafts', name: 'Drafts', type: 'drafts', unreadCount: 2 },
    ...
  ]
}
```

### 3. **Real-time Email Delivery** (Webhooks)
- ✅ Sets up Nylas webhooks for instant notifications
- ✅ New emails appear immediately without manual sync
- ✅ Monitors: message.created, message.updated, message.deleted, thread.replied
- ✅ Webhook ID stored in database for tracking

**Webhook Triggers:**
- `message.created` - New email received
- `message.updated` - Email marked as read/unread, starred, etc.
- `message.deleted` - Email moved to trash
- `thread.replied` - Someone replied to your email

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Pagination Implementation
```typescript
// Automatically loops through all pages
do {
  const response = await listNylasMessages(grantId, {
    limit: 50,
    pageToken,
  });
  
  // Process emails...
  
  pageToken = response.nextCursor;
} while (pageToken);
```

### Folder Sync
```typescript
const folders = await listNylasFolders(grantId);
// Returns all folders with metadata
```

### Webhook Setup
```typescript
const webhook = await createNylasWebhook(
  'https://your-app.com/api/webhooks/nylas',
  ['message.created', 'message.updated', 'message.deleted', 'thread.replied']
);
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Download All Emails" taking too long?
- Normal for accounts with 1000+ emails
- Watch the terminal for progress: `Page 1`, `Page 2`, etc.
- Don't refresh the page during sync

### "Enable Real-time" button not working?
- Check that `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` is set correctly in `.env.local`
- Webhook URL must be publicly accessible (use ngrok for local dev)

### Emails not appearing after sync?
- Hard refresh browser: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
- Check console logs for errors
- Make sure emails were actually synced (check terminal logs)
