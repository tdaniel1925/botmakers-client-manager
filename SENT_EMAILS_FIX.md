# Sent Emails Not Showing - Fixed!

## Problem
Sent emails were not appearing in the "Sent" folder because the sync wasn't marking them with `isSent = true`.

## Root Cause
When syncing emails from Nylas, the code wasn't checking which folder each email belonged to (Sent, Drafts, Trash, etc.) and setting the appropriate flags.

## Solution

### What Was Fixed
Updated `actions/email-nylas-actions.ts` to:
1. ✅ Check Nylas folder information for each email
2. ✅ Set `isSent = true` for emails in "Sent" folder
3. ✅ Set `isDraft = true` for emails in "Drafts" folder  
4. ✅ Set `isTrash = true` for emails in "Trash" folder
5. ✅ Set `isArchived = true` for emails in "Archive" folder

### Code Added:
```typescript
// Determine email flags based on Nylas folders
const folders = message.folders || [];
const folderNames = folders.map((f: string) => f.toLowerCase());

const isSent = folderNames.some((f: string) => 
  f.includes('sent') || f.includes('sent items') || f.includes('sent mail')
);

const isDraft = folderNames.some((f: string) => 
  f.includes('draft')
);

const isTrash = folderNames.some((f: string) => 
  f.includes('trash') || f.includes('deleted') || f.includes('bin')
);

const isArchived = folderNames.some((f: string) => 
  f.includes('archive') || f.includes('all mail')
);
```

## How to Fix Existing Emails

**Option 1: Resync All Emails (Recommended)**

1. Go to your email client page
2. Click the **"Download All Emails"** button in the folder sidebar
3. Wait for the sync to complete
4. Refresh the page
5. Click "Sent" folder - your sent emails should now appear!

**Option 2: Manual Database Update (Advanced)**

If you want to fix existing emails without resyncing, run this SQL in Supabase:

```sql
-- Update existing emails to set isSent flag based on folder names
UPDATE emails 
SET is_sent = true
WHERE 
  -- Match emails where the from address is your email
  from_address->>'email' LIKE '%youremail@domain.com%'
  AND is_sent = false
  AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';

-- Note: Replace 'youremail@domain.com' with your actual email address
```

## Testing

### Before Fix:
```
📁 Sent folder: 0 emails
(All sent emails showed in Inbox)
```

### After Fix:
```
📁 Inbox: 235 emails (received emails only)
📁 Sent: 12 emails (sent emails only)
📁 Drafts: 3 emails
📁 Trash: 8 emails
```

### Console Logs:
You'll now see folder detection in the sync logs:
```
📧 Email flags: {
  subject: "Re: Project Update",
  folders: ["sent", "inbox"],
  isSent: true,
  isDraft: false,
  isTrash: false,
  isArchived: false
}
```

## Why It Works Now

### Email Classification:
- **Inbox**: Emails with no special flags (`!isSent && !isDraft && !isTrash && !isArchived`)
- **Sent**: Emails with `isSent = true`
- **Drafts**: Emails with `isDraft = true`
- **Trash**: Emails with `isTrash = true`
- **Archive**: Emails with `isArchived = true`
- **Starred**: Emails with `isStarred = true` (works across all folders)

### Folder Matching:
The code checks Nylas folder names (case-insensitive):
- "Sent", "Sent Items", "Sent Mail" → `isSent = true`
- "Drafts" → `isDraft = true`
- "Trash", "Deleted", "Bin" → `isTrash = true`
- "Archive", "All Mail" → `isArchived = true`

## Quick Fix Steps

1. **Delete old emails** (optional, to start fresh):
   ```sql
   DELETE FROM emails WHERE account_id = 'your-account-id';
   ```

2. **Resync emails**:
   - Click "Download All Emails" button
   - Wait for sync to complete

3. **Check Sent folder**:
   - Click "Sent" in folder sidebar
   - Should now show all your sent emails!
