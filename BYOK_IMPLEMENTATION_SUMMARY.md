# BYOK Messaging Implementation Summary

## Overview

The Bring Your Own Keys (BYOK) messaging system has been successfully implemented, allowing organizations to configure their own Twilio and Resend credentials for SMS and email messaging.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Layer ✅
- **New Table**: `organization_messaging_credentials`
  - Stores encrypted Twilio and Resend credentials per organization
  - Tracks verification status and last tested timestamps
  - One-to-one relationship with organizations

### 2. Security Layer ✅
- **Encryption**: `lib/credential-encryption.ts`
  - AES-256-GCM encryption for sensitive credentials
  - Random IV per encryption operation
  - Authentication tags for integrity verification

- **Validation**: `lib/messaging/credential-validator.ts`
  - Tests Twilio credentials by fetching account details
  - Tests Resend credentials by listing domains
  - Verifies phone numbers and email domains

### 3. Service Layer ✅
- **Credential Manager**: `lib/messaging/credential-manager.ts`
  - Fetches org-specific or platform credentials
  - Automatic fallback to platform credentials
  - Tracks which credentials are being used

- **Organization Context**: `lib/messaging/organization-context.ts`
  - Helper functions to get organization ID from project/campaign/call

### 4. Data Access Layer ✅
- **Queries**: `db/queries/organization-credentials-queries.ts`
  - CRUD operations for credentials
  - Specialized functions for Twilio and Resend

- **Server Actions**: `actions/organization-credentials-actions.ts`
  - Secure server actions for credential management
  - Authentication and authorization checks
  - Credential masking for display

### 5. Integration Layer ✅
- **Workflow Engine**: `lib/workflow-engine.ts`
  - Updated to use org-specific credentials
  - Proper error handling and logging
  - Falls back gracefully on errors

- **Email Service**: `lib/email-service.ts`
  - Added `organizationId` parameter to `sendEmail`
  - Backward compatible with existing code
  - Uses org credentials when provided

### 6. User Interface ✅
- **Settings Page**: `app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx`
  - New "Messaging" tab in organization settings

- **Credentials UI**: `components/settings/messaging-credentials-settings.tsx`
  - Two-section form (Twilio and Resend)
  - Toggle switches, input fields, status badges
  - Test connection and save functionality
  - Revert to platform credentials option

### 7. Documentation ✅
- **User Guide**: `BYOK_MESSAGING_GUIDE.md`
  - Step-by-step setup instructions
  - Pricing information
  - Troubleshooting guide
  - Security best practices

- **Technical Documentation**: `ADMIN_BYOK_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
  - Architecture overview
  - Component descriptions
  - Data flow diagrams
  - Monitoring and testing guidance

## Required Environment Variables

Add this to your `.env` or `.env.local` file:

```bash
# REQUIRED: Encryption key for BYOK credentials (32 bytes)
# Generate with: openssl rand -hex 32
CREDENTIALS_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_64_character_hex_key_here

# OPTIONAL: Platform-wide credentials (fallback)
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+1234567890

RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
RESEND_REPLY_TO=support@yourdomain.com
```

### Generating the Encryption Key

Run this command to generate a secure encryption key:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

Copy the output (64 characters) and add it to your environment as `CREDENTIALS_ENCRYPTION_KEY`.

## Database Migration

The database schema has been successfully pushed using Drizzle:

```bash
npx drizzle-kit push
```

This created the `organization_messaging_credentials` table with all required columns and indexes.

## How It Works

### For Organizations (Users)

1. **Navigate to Settings → Messaging**
2. **Toggle on "Use Custom Twilio Account" or "Use Custom Email Service"**
3. **Enter credentials** (Account SID, Auth Token, Phone Number for Twilio; API Key, From Email for Resend)
4. **Click "Save & Test Credentials"** - credentials are validated before saving
5. **Verified ✓ badge** appears when credentials are working

From this point forward, all messaging for that organization uses their credentials.

### For Developers (Technical Flow)

1. **Campaign sends SMS/Email**
   - Workflow engine executes action
   - Gets organization ID from project
   - Calls `getMessagingCredentials(organizationId)`

2. **Credential Manager**
   - Fetches org credentials from database
   - If org has enabled + verified credentials:
     - Decrypts sensitive values
     - Creates provider client
     - Returns org client
   - Else: Returns platform client (from env vars)

3. **Message Sent**
   - Uses the returned client
   - Logs which credentials were used
   - Tracks success/failure

## Key Features

### ✅ Hybrid Model
- Platform credentials work by default
- Organizations can opt-in to BYOK
- Seamless fallback if org credentials not configured

### ✅ Secure Storage
- All secrets encrypted with AES-256-GCM
- Auth tokens and API keys never displayed in UI
- Encryption key stored in environment variable

### ✅ Validation
- Credentials tested before saving
- Real API calls to providers
- Verification status tracked

### ✅ User-Friendly UI
- Clear toggle switches
- Status badges (Verified ✓ / Not Verified)
- Test connection buttons
- Easy revert to platform credentials

### ✅ Backward Compatible
- Existing code continues to work
- No breaking changes
- Optional feature that organizations enable

## Testing Checklist

Before deploying to production, test the following:

### Setup
- [ ] Generate and set `CREDENTIALS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` in environment
- [ ] Set platform credentials (TWILIO_*, RESEND_*) in environment
- [ ] Database migration completed successfully
- [ ] Server restarts successfully

### Twilio Flow
- [ ] Navigate to Settings → Messaging
- [ ] Toggle on "Use Custom Twilio Account"
- [ ] Enter valid Twilio credentials
- [ ] Click "Save & Test Credentials" → Should show "Verified ✓"
- [ ] Create a test campaign with SMS follow-up
- [ ] Trigger workflow that sends SMS
- [ ] Verify SMS received using org credentials
- [ ] Check logs for "Using organization credentials"

### Resend Flow
- [ ] Navigate to Settings → Messaging
- [ ] Toggle on "Use Custom Email Service"
- [ ] Enter valid Resend credentials
- [ ] Click "Save & Test Credentials" → Should show "Verified ✓"
- [ ] Create a test campaign with email follow-up
- [ ] Trigger workflow that sends email
- [ ] Verify email received using org credentials
- [ ] Check logs for "Using organization credentials"

### Error Handling
- [ ] Try saving invalid Twilio credentials → Should show error
- [ ] Try saving invalid Resend credentials → Should show error
- [ ] Disable org credentials → Should fall back to platform
- [ ] Test with missing platform credentials → Should show error

### Security
- [ ] Verify auth tokens are masked in UI (`••••••••••••`)
- [ ] Verify API keys are masked in UI (`••••••••••••`)
- [ ] Check database: credentials are encrypted (not plaintext)
- [ ] Test decryption with wrong key → Should fail gracefully
