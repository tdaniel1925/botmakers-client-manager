## 🔧 Technical Notes

### Database
- Migration `0027_hey_features.sql` successfully applied
- All indexes created for performance
- Ready for production use

### Architecture Decisions
- **Classification**: Fast rule-based (can upgrade to OpenAI later)
- **Screening**: Opt-in (users choose Traditional/Hey mode)
- **Views**: Filter-based (not separate folders)
- **Performance**: Client-side filtering + indexes

### Integration Points
- Email sync: Auto-classify on arrival
- Nylas webhooks: Trigger screening for new senders
- Existing features: Works alongside current email client
- Backwards compatible: Traditional mode preserves current workflow

## ⚠️ Important Decisions Needed

Before continuing implementation, please confirm:

1. **Scope**: Implement all phases or focus on core features first?
   - Option A: Full implementation (6 weeks, all features)
   - Option B: MVP (2 weeks, Screening + 3 Views + Reply Later)
   - Option C: Incremental (build phase by phase with user feedback)

2. **Design Direction**: How closely to match Hey's visual style?
   - Option A: Exact Hey replica (yellow/black, bold)
   - Option B: Hey-inspired but branded
   - Option C: Keep current design, add Hey features

3. **Default Mode**: What should be the default experience?
   - Option A: Traditional (current inbox, Hey features opt-in)
   - Option B: Hey Mode (screening required, new workflow)
   - Option C: Guided choice (user picks on first login)

4. **Rollout Strategy**:
   - Option A: Beta flag (test with select users)
   - Option B: All users, Traditional mode default
   - Option C: New users only (existing users keep current)

## 🎉 What's Working Now

Even though UI isn't built yet, the foundation is solid:

✅ **Database** - All tables and columns ready
✅ **Classification** - Emails can be auto-categorized
✅ **Screening** - Backend logic to screen senders
✅ **Reply Later** - Mark emails for later workflow
✅ **Set Aside** - Temporary holding system
✅ **Bubble Up** - Resurface old threads

**Ready to build UI on top of this foundation!**

## 💡 Recommendations

Based on Hey's success and your goals:

1. **Start with MVP**: Screening + 3 Views + Reply Later
2. **User test early**: Get feedback before full design overhaul
3. **Incremental rollout**: Traditional mode default, Hey opt-in
4. **Mobile-first**: Many users check email on phone
5. **Performance first**: Speed is Hey's competitive advantage

**Next Action**: Please review this status and let me know:
1. Which scope option you prefer (A/B/C)
2. Your design direction preference
3. Any specific features you want prioritized
4. Whether to continue implementation or pause for feedback

I'm ready to continue building as soon as you provide direction! 🚀
