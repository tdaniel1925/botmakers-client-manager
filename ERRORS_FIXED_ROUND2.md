# ✅ All Runtime Errors Fixed - Round 2

## Issues Resolved

### 1. ✅ Keyboard Shortcuts "Not Iterable" Error

**Problem**: Two versions of the keyboard shortcuts hook existed:
- `use-keyboard-shortcuts.tsx` (old, expected array)
- `use-keyboard-shortcuts.ts` (new, expected object)

The app was importing the old `.tsx` version which expected an array but received an object.

**Fix**: Deleted the duplicate `.tsx` file

**File Deleted:**
- `hooks/use-keyboard-shortcuts.tsx`

---

### 2. ✅ "Failed to Fetch" Server Actions Error

**Problem**: Database tables for Hey features didn't exist, causing server actions to fail.

**Fix**: Ran the Hey features migration script

**Tables Created/Verified:**
- ✅ `contact_screening` - Email screening decisions
- ✅ `user_email_preferences` - User mode preferences
- ✅ Hey-specific columns in `emails` table
- ✅ Performance indexes

**Migration Script:**
```bash
npx tsx scripts/run-hey-migration.ts
```

**Result:** All database tables and columns now exist

---

## What Was Fixed

### Keyboard Shortcuts Now Work
```typescript
// In email-layout.tsx
const shortcuts = {
  commandPalette: { key: 'k', metaKey: true, action: ... },
  imbox: { key: '1', action: ... },
  feed: { key: '2', action: ... },
  // ... etc
};

useKeyboardShortcuts(shortcuts); // Now works!
```

**Available Shortcuts:**
- **`Cmd+K`** / **`Ctrl+K`** → Command Palette
- **`/`** → Instant Search
- **`C`** → Compose
- **`1`** → Imbox
- **`2`** → The Feed
- **`3`** → Paper Trail
- **`4`** → Screener
- **`L`** → Reply Later
- **`S`** → Set Aside

### Email Screening Now Works

The Hey-style screener is fully functional:

**Features:**
- Screen new senders with Yes/Feed/Block
- AI-powered suggestions
- Automatic email classification

**Database Schema:**
```sql
contact_screening table:
