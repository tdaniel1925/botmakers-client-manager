## 🔍 How to Verify

### Step-by-Step Test:

1. **Go to Screener:**
   - Click "Screener" in sidebar
   - See list of new senders

2. **Click "Yes - Imbox":**
   - Card slides away
   - Toast appears: "✨ Moved to Imbox"
   - Check console: "📬 Emails will now appear in: ✨ Imbox"

3. **Navigate to Imbox:**
   - Click "Imbox" in sidebar
   - See the screened email!

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### 1. Database Updates

```typescript
// Update email with correct heyView
await db.update(emailsTable).set({
  heyView: decision, // 'imbox', 'feed', 'paper_trail', or null
  screeningStatus: 'screened',
});
```

### 2. View Filtering

**Imbox View:**
```typescript
const imboxEmails = emails.filter(email => 
  email.heyView === 'imbox'
);
```

**Feed View:**
```typescript
const feedEmails = emails.filter(email => 
  email.heyView === 'feed'
);
```

**Paper Trail View:**
```typescript
const paperTrailEmails = emails.filter(email => 
  email.heyView === 'paper_trail'
);
```

**Blocked Emails:**
```typescript
// heyView = null
// Not shown in any view
```

### 3. Future Email Auto-Routing

```typescript
// When new emails arrive from screened senders:
const screeningResult = await getScreeningDecision(sender);

if (screeningResult.data) {
  // Apply screening decision automatically
  email.heyView = screeningResult.data;
  email.screeningStatus = 'screened';
}
```

**Result:** Future emails automatically go to the right folder!

## 📊 Where Emails Appear

### Routing Table:

| Decision | heyView | Appears In | Hidden From |
|----------|---------|------------|-------------|
| Yes - Imbox | `'imbox'` | ✅ Imbox | Feed, Paper Trail |
| The Feed | `'feed'` | ✅ The Feed | Imbox, Paper Trail |
| Paper Trail | `'paper_trail'` | ✅ Paper Trail | Imbox, Feed |
| Block | `null` | 🚫 Hidden | All views |

### Also Appears In:

**Traditional Folders:**
- Imbox emails → Also in "Inbox" folder
- Feed emails → Also in "Inbox" folder  
- Paper Trail emails → Also in "Inbox" folder
- Blocked emails → **Not visible anywhere**

**You get both Hey views AND traditional folders!**
