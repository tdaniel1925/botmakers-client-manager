# ✅ Implementation Complete: Voice Campaign Features

**Date:** October 8, 2025  
**Status:** 🎉 **100% COMPLETE**  
**All requirements from `PRD/Instructions.md` have been successfully implemented**

---

## 📝 What Was Implemented

### ✅ 1. CRITICAL: Vapi Model Configuration
**Fixed:** Changed Vapi model from `gpt-4o` to `gpt-4o-mini`
- **File:** `lib/voice-providers/vapi-provider.ts` (line 44)
- **Impact:** All future campaigns use the correct GPT-4o-mini model

---

### ✅ 2. Contact List Upload System
**Complete CSV/Excel upload with column mapping**

**Features:**
- ✅ Supports CSV, XLSX, XLS files
- ✅ Smart column detection and mapping UI
- ✅ Phone number validation
- ✅ Duplicate detection
- ✅ Upload statistics and summary
- ✅ Batch processing for large files

**Files Created:**
- `components/voice-campaigns/contact-list-upload.tsx`
- `lib/csv-parser.ts`
- `actions/campaign-contacts-actions.ts`
- `db/schema/campaign-contacts-schema.ts`
- `db/queries/campaign-contacts-queries.ts`

---

### ✅ 3. Timezone Detection & Mapping
**Automatic timezone detection from area codes**

**Coverage:**
- ✅ All 50 US states
- ✅ 500+ area codes mapped
- ✅ 6 timezones: ET, CT, MT, PT, AKT, HAT
- ✅ DST handling (Arizona, Hawaii exceptions)

**Utilities:**
```typescript
getTimezoneFromPhoneNumber("+12125551234")
calculateTimezoneSummary(phoneNumbers)
formatPhoneNumber("2125551234") // +12125551234
```

**File:** `lib/timezone-mapper.ts`

---

### ✅ 4. Campaign Summary with Timezone Report

- ✅ Color-coded badges per timezone
- ✅ Percentage calculations
- ✅ Call statistics integration

**File:** `components/voice-campaigns/campaign-summary.tsx`

---

### ✅ 5. Pending Status & Launch Confirmation
**Campaigns require explicit launch**

**Workflow:**
1. Campaign created → Status: `pending`, Active: `false`
2. Upload contacts → Review summary
3. Click "Launch Campaign" → Confirmation dialog
4. Confirm → Status: `active`, Active: `true`

**Features:**
- ✅ Launch confirmation dialog with details
- ✅ Different messaging for inbound/outbound/both
- ✅ Credit usage warning
- ✅ Pause/Resume functionality

**Files:**
- `components/voice-campaigns/launch-campaign-dialog.tsx`

    { start: "09:00", end: "12:00", label: "Morning" },
    { start: "13:00", end: "17:00", label: "Afternoon" }
  ],
  respectTimezones: true,
  maxAttemptsPerContact: 3,
  timeBetweenAttempts: 24, // hours
  maxConcurrentCalls: 10
}
```

**Files:**
- `lib/campaign-scheduler.ts`
- `db/schema/voice-campaigns-schema.ts` (added `schedule_config` field)

---

### ✅ 7. SMS & Email Templates System
**Automated messaging based on call outcomes**

**Database Tables:**

- `components/voice-campaigns/message-template-form.tsx`

---

### ✅ 8. Database Schema & Migration
**All database changes with proper indexes**

**New Tables:**
- `campaign_contacts` (contact list with timezone data)
- `campaign_contact_uploads` (upload tracking)
- `campaign_message_templates` (SMS/email templates)
- `campaign_messaging_config` (messaging settings)
- `campaign_message_log` (message send history)

**Schema Updates:**

- Added `schedule_config` JSONB field to `voice_campaigns`

**Indexes Created:**

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install papaparse xlsx
npm install -D @types/papaparse
```

### 2. Run Migration
```bash
npx drizzle-kit push
# OR
psql -d your_database -f db/migrations/add-campaign-features.sql
```

### 3. Use Components
```tsx
import { ContactListUpload } from "@/components/voice-campaigns/contact-list-upload";
import { CampaignSummary } from "@/components/voice-campaigns/campaign-summary";
import { LaunchCampaignDialog } from "@/components/voice-campaigns/launch-campaign-dialog";

// In your campaign detail page:

<CampaignSummary campaign={campaign} />
<LaunchCampaignDialog campaign={campaign} onLaunched={() => router.refresh()} />
```

## 🔄 Typical Workflow

```
1. Admin creates campaign via wizard
   └─> Status: pending, Active: false

2. Campaign appears in list with "Launch" button

3. Admin uploads contact list (CSV/Excel)
   └─> System maps columns
   └─> Detects timezones from area codes
   └─> Shows upload summary

4. Admin reviews campaign summary
   └─> See contact count
   └─> See timezone distribution
   └─> View statistics

5. Admin clicks "Launch Campaign"
   └─> Confirmation dialog appears
   └─> Shows what will happen
   └─> Admin confirms

6. Campaign launches
   └─> Status: pending → active
   └─> Active: false → true
   └─> Phone number becomes active

7. For outbound campaigns:
   └─> Scheduler runs (cron job)
   └─> Calls placed based on schedule
   └─> Respects local timezones
   └─> Max attempts enforced

8. For inbound campaigns:
   └─> Phone number receives calls
   └─> AI agent handles calls
   └─> Data recorded

9. Messages sent based on outcomes:
   └─> SMS after positive calls
   └─> Email after voicemails
   └─> Follow-up messages
```
