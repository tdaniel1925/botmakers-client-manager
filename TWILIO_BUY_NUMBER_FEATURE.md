### Best Practices

1. **Test Area Codes First** - Search your preferred area code to see availability

**Solutions:**

- Check Twilio's availability status page

### "Failed to purchase number"

**Possible Causes:**
1. Insufficient Twilio account balance
2. Number was just purchased by someone else
3. Twilio account limits reached

**Solutions:**

- Check your Twilio account limits/quotas

### "Twilio is not configured"

```
Then restart the server.
