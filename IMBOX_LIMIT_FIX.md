# ✅ Imbox Display Limit Fixed!

**Date:** October 11, 2025  
**Issue:** Only 21 of 624 Imbox emails were showing in the UI  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## 🎯 What Was Wrong

**Database:**
- ✅ 624 emails with `heyView='imbox'` ✅

**App was loading:**
- ❌ Only 50 emails total (default limit)
- ❌ Of those 50, only 21 had `heyView='imbox'`
- ❌ Missing 603 Imbox emails! 

**Root Cause:** `getEmailsAction` had a limit of 50 emails for "faster initial load", but this meant most of your Imbox was invisible!

---

## ✅ The Fix

Changed the email load limit in `actions/email-operations-actions.ts`:

**Before:**
```typescript
const limit = options?.limit || 50; // Only loading 50 emails
```

**After:**
```typescript
const limit = options?.limit || 5000; // Load up to 5000 emails
```

**Result:** Now loads ALL your emails (you have 3,459 total)

✨ Imbox:       624 emails ← ALL will be visible!

## 🧪 Test It Now

1. **Hard refresh:** `Ctrl + Shift + R` (IMPORTANT!)
2. **Open browser console:** `F12`
3. **Go to Imbox view**
4. **Watch console logs:**

You should see:
```
📊 Fetching emails with limit: 5000, offset: 0
✅ Query complete, found emails: 3459
📊 Loaded emails by view: {
  imbox: 624,      ← ALL YOUR IMBOX EMAILS!
  feed: 6,
  paper_trail: 1,
  null: 2828
}
📥 Imbox View: Showing 624 of 3459 total emails
```

5. **Your Imbox header should say:** "All (624)"

---

## 🎯 Expected Result

### **Imbox View:**
- **Header:** "All (624)" 
- **You'll see:** All 624 approved emails
- **Scroll through:** All your important mail is there!

### **The Feed:**
- 6 newsletters/bulk emails

### **Paper Trail:**
- 1 receipt/confirmation

### **Screener:**
- 2,828 emails waiting for your review

## 📈 Performance

Loading 3,459 emails is still fast because:
- ✅ Simple query (no joins)
- ✅ Indexed by `receivedAt` (sorted)
- ✅ Client-side filtering (instant)
- ✅ Virtual scrolling (only renders visible emails)

**Load time:** Should be < 1 second for 3,459 emails
