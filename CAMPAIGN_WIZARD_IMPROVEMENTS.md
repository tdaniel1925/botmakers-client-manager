# Campaign Wizard Improvements

## Summary

Three key improvements have been made to the voice campaign creation wizard to enhance prompt quality and user experience.

## ‚úÖ Improvements Implemented

### 1. **Markdown Formatting for AI-Generated Prompts**

- Uses bullet points (*) for better readability
- Structured with headers (##) for clear organization

**Why This Matters:**

- Easier for admins to review and edit the generated prompts
- More professional and organized output

**Technical Details:**
- Updated `lib/ai-campaign-generator.ts`
- Modified the GPT-4 generation prompt to explicitly request Markdown format
- System prompts now include sections like:
  - ## Role Definition
  - ## Personality & Tone
  - ## Conversation Objectives
  - ## Data Collection Requirements
  - ## Handling Common Scenarios
  - ## Professional Etiquette

**Example Output:**
```markdown
## Role Definition
* You are a professional customer support agent for [Company]
* Your role is to help customers with inquiries and resolve issues

## Personality & Tone

* Clear and concise communication

### 2. **AI Writer for Business Descriptions** ‚ú®

**What Changed:**
- Added an "AI Writer" button next to the business context field
- Opens a smart dialog that asks for basic company info
- AI generates a detailed, professional business description

**Why This Matters:**
- Users often struggle to write good business descriptions
- Better descriptions = better AI agent prompts
- Saves time and ensures quality context

**How It Works:**

1. User clicks **"AI Writer"** button
2. Dialog opens with simple questions:
   - What type of company is this?
   - Industry
   - Main product/service
   - Target customers
   - Key features (optional)
3. AI generates a 2-4 sentence professional description
4. Description is automatically filled into the business context field

**Technical Implementation:**
- **New Files:**
  - `lib/ai-business-description-writer.ts` - AI generation logic
  - `actions/ai-description-actions.ts` - Server action
- **Modified Files:**
  - `components/voice-campaigns/campaign-questions-form.tsx` - Added button and dialog

**User Experience:**

```
Before (user writes):
"We sell software."

After (AI writes):
"We're a SaaS company that helps small businesses manage their inventory. 
We offer a cloud-based platform with real-time tracking, automated reordering, 
and analytics. Our solution serves retail stores, restaurants, and warehouses 
looking to streamline their operations."
```

### 3. **Removed Call Duration Target Field**

- Voice agents will naturally end calls when appropriate

**Technical Details:**
- **Modified Files:**
  - `types/campaign-setup-questions.ts` - Removed question definition

## Troubleshooting

### AI Writer Not Working
**Problem:** "Failed to generate description" error

**Solutions:**
1. Check `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env.local`
2. Ensure OpenAI API has available credits
3. Check server logs for detailed error messages

### Markdown Not Rendering
**Problem:** Prompts show raw markdown (with `*` and `##`)

**Solutions:**
1. This is expected in the preview - voice providers parse markdown
2. If you need HTML rendering, consider adding a markdown parser to the preview component

### Call Duration Issues
**Problem:** Campaign creation fails with "call_duration_target required"

**Solutions:**
1. Clear browser cache and refresh
2. Ensure you're running the latest code
3. Check that `estimatedCallDuration` defaults to 5 in `ai-campaign-generator.ts`

---
