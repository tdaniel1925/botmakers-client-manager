## 🔧 Technical Changes

### 1. Added Callback to ScreenerView

**Before:**
```typescript
export function ScreenerView() {
  const handleScreened = (emailAddress: string) => {
    setSenders(prev => prev.filter(s => s.emailAddress !== emailAddress));
    // ❌ No refresh!
  };
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
export function ScreenerView({ onEmailsUpdated }) {
  const handleScreened = (emailAddress: string) => {
    setSenders(prev => prev.filter(s => s.emailAddress !== emailAddress));
    
    // ✅ Refresh emails in parent!
    if (onEmailsUpdated) {
      onEmailsUpdated();
    }
  };
}
```

### 2. Connected to Email Refresh

**EmailLayout.tsx:**
```typescript
case 'screener':
  return <ScreenerView onEmailsUpdated={loadEmails} />;
```

Now when you screen an email, it triggers `loadEmails()` which fetches fresh data from the database with the updated `heyView` values!

### 3. Added Debug Logging

**ImboxView.tsx:**
```typescript
const imboxEmails = emails.filter(email => {
  const isImbox = email.heyView === 'imbox';
  if (isImbox) {
    console.log('✅ Email in Imbox:', {
      subject: email.subject,
      from: email.fromAddress,
      heyView: email.heyView,
      screeningStatus: email.screeningStatus
    });
  }
  return isImbox;
});

console.log(`📥 Imbox View: Showing ${imboxEmails.length} of ${emails.length} total emails`);
```

## 🔍 Debugging Guide

### If Emails Still Don't Appear:

**Check Console for These Logs:**

1. **Database Update:**
   ```
   ✅ Screened X emails from [email] as "imbox"
   ```
   - If missing → Database update failed
   - If present → Database is correct ✅

2. **Refresh Triggered:**
   ```
   📧 Loading emails for account: ...
   ```
   - If missing → Refresh not triggered
   - If present → Refresh is working ✅

3. **Imbox Filtering:**
   ```
   📥 Imbox View: Showing X of Y total emails
   ```
   - If X = 0 → No emails have heyView = 'imbox'
   - If X > 0 → Emails found ✅

4. **Individual Emails:**
   ```
   ✅ Email in Imbox: {
     heyView: "imbox",  ← Should be "imbox"
     screeningStatus: "screened"  ← Should be "screened"
   }
   ```
   - Check `heyView` value
   - Check `screeningStatus` value

### Common Issues:

**Issue 1: Database Not Updating**
- Console shows: "Failed to screen sender"
- Solution: Check database connection

**Issue 2: Refresh Not Triggered**
- No "📧 Loading emails..." message
- Solution: Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

**Issue 3: Wrong heyView Value**
- Email shows but `heyView` is not "imbox"
- Solution: Check screening logic

**Issue 4: Filtering Not Working**
- Refresh happens but Imbox shows 0 emails
- Solution: Check filter logic in ImboxView
