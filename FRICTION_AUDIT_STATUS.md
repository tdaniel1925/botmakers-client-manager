## Notes

The voice campaigns area is **significantly more polished** than the rest of the app. This creates an **inconsistent experience** where:
- Voice campaigns feel modern and responsive
- Other areas (contacts, deals, projects) feel dated and clunky

**Recommendation:** Apply the same patterns used in voice campaigns to the rest of the app for consistency.
