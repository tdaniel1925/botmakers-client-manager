## 🎯 Key Achievements

### 1. Transaction-Based Campaign Creation ✅

**Problem Solved:** When campaign creation fails (e.g., phone provisioning error), orphaned resources (webhooks, agents) were left in provider systems, causing confusion and potential billing issues.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Created `lib/campaign-transaction.ts` - Transaction manager class
- Tracks all resources as they're created (webhook → agent → phone number)
- Automatic rollback in reverse order on any error
- Detailed logging for debugging

**Files Created/Modified:**
- ✅ `lib/campaign-transaction.ts` (new)
- ✅ `actions/voice-campaign-actions.ts` (modified)

**Code Example:**
```typescript
// Campaign creation now wrapped in transaction
const result = await withTransaction(async (transaction) => {
  const webhook = await createWebhook(...);
  transaction.track({ type: "webhook", id: webhook.id });
  
  const agent = await provider.createAgent(...);
  transaction.track({ type: "agent", id: agent.id, provider });
  
  const phoneNumber = await provider.provisionPhoneNumber(...);
  transaction.track({ type: "phoneNumber", id: phoneNumber.id, provider });
  
  // If any step fails, all tracked resources are automatically deleted
  return { campaign, phoneNumber, agentId };
});
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ **No more orphaned resources**
- ✅ **Clean failure recovery**
- ✅ **Detailed error logging**
- ✅ **Prevents billing leaks**

### 2. Auto Phone Number Polling ✅

**Problem Solved:** Phone numbers from Vapi show as "pending" initially. Users had to manually click "Check Number" repeatedly, creating a poor UX.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Created `hooks/use-phone-number-polling.ts`
- Polls every 5 seconds for up to 5 minutes
- Automatic store updates when number is ready
- Supports bulk polling for multiple campaigns
- Visual feedback with animated badges

**Files Created/Modified:**
- ✅ `hooks/use-phone-number-polling.ts` (new)
- ✅ `components/voice-campaigns/campaigns-list.tsx` (modified)

**Code Example:**
```typescript
// Single campaign polling
usePhoneNumberPolling({
  campaignId: campaign.id,
  phoneNumber: campaign.phoneNumber,
  enabled: true,
  interval: 5000, // 5 seconds
  maxAttempts: 60, // 5 minutes total
  onSuccess: (phoneNumber) => {
    updateCampaign(campaignId, { phoneNumber });
    toast.success(`Phone number assigned: ${phoneNumber}`);
  },
});

// Bulk polling for all campaigns
const { pollingCount } = useBulkPhoneNumberPolling(
  campaigns.map((c) => ({ id: c.id, phoneNumber: c.phoneNumber || "" }))
);
```

**Visual Improvements:**
- ❌ **Before:** "Check Number" button (manual, annoying)
- ✅ **After:** Animated "Provisioning..." badge (automatic, smooth)
- ✅ Header shows "{n} provisioning" badge
- ✅ Toast notification when ready

**Impact:**
- ✅ **Zero manual intervention needed**
- ✅ **Professional, automatic UX**
- ✅ **Real-time updates**
- ✅ **Handles provider delays gracefully**

### 3. Wizard Progress Auto-Save ✅

**Problem Solved:** Users lose all progress if they accidentally close the wizard or navigate away. This is especially frustrating on long setup forms.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Created `lib/wizard-storage.ts` - localStorage-based persistence
- Auto-saves on every state change
- Shows "Resume" banner on next visit
- 7-day expiration for old progress
- Version tracking for schema migrations

**Files Created/Modified:**
- ✅ `lib/wizard-storage.ts` (new)
- ✅ `components/voice-campaigns/campaign-wizard.tsx` (modified)

**Features:**
- ✅ Auto-save after every answer
- ✅ Resume banner on return ("saved 2 hours ago")
- ✅ "Start Fresh" option to clear progress
- ✅ Per-project storage (multi-project support)
- ✅ Automatic cleanup of old progress
- ✅ Skips saving on generating/testing steps

**Visual UI:**
```
╔════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  🔄 Resume Your Campaign?                      ║
║  You have unsaved progress from 2 hours ago    ║
║                                                 ║
║  [Start Fresh]  [Resume →]                     ║
╚════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ **Never lose progress**
- ✅ **Multi-session support**
- ✅ **Better conversion rates**
- ✅ **User-friendly recovery**
