## üìã Quick Copy-Paste Template

For any remaining file:

```typescript
// 1. Add import at top
import { useConfirm } from "@/hooks/use-confirm";

// 2. Add hook in component
const { confirm, ConfirmDialog } = useConfirm();

// 3. Replace confirm() calls
// Before:
if (!confirm("Are you sure?")) return;

// After:
const confirmed = await confirm({
  title: "Action Title?",
  description: "Detailed description of what will happen.",
  confirmText: "Confirm Button Text",
  variant: "danger", // or "warning" or "info"
});
if (!confirmed) return;

// 4. Add dialog to return statement (before closing tag)
return (
  <>
    {/* ... existing JSX ... */}
    <ConfirmDialog />
  </>
);
```
