---

## üéØ Current Bottleneck

The biggest UX improvements are blocked by:
- **Search functionality** - Users can't find items quickly
- **Bulk actions** - Users can't manage at scale
- **Campaign analytics** - Users can't troubleshoot or optimize

**Recommendation:** Focus on Phases 1-3 first (7-9 days total) for maximum impact.

---

## üìù Notes

- Voice campaigns are already significantly more polished than rest of app
- Need to apply same patterns (store, bulk actions, search) to other areas
- Users will notice immediate improvement from Phase 1 alone
- Phases 2-3 are essential for professional-grade app
- Phases 4-5 are nice polish but not critical

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

Waiting for user input on prioritization:
1. Continue with batch fixes (confirms + refreshes)?
2. Jump to search & bulk actions?
3. Focus on campaign analytics?
4. Something else?
