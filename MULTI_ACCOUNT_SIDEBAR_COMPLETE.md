## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Files Modified:

#### 1. `components/email/folder-sidebar.tsx`
**Changes:**
- Added account switcher UI at top of sidebar
- Added Select dropdown for account selection
- Implemented account color coding
- Added status indicators (green/yellow/red dots)
- Calculated per-account unread counts
- Integrated "Add Account" option

**New Props:**
```typescript
interface FolderSidebarProps {
  // Existing
  selectedFolder: string;
  folders: any[];
  onFolderChange: (folder: string) => void;
  
  // New - Account Management
  accounts: SelectEmailAccount[];
  selectedAccount: SelectEmailAccount | null;
  onAccountChange: (accountId: string) => void;
  onAddAccount: () => void;
}
```

#### 2. `components/email/email-layout.tsx`
**Changes:**
- Updated FolderSidebar component usage
- Passed accounts and selectedAccount
- Passed account change handler
- Connected "Add Account" to dialog

**Integration:**
```tsx
<FolderSidebar
  selectedFolder={selectedFolder}
  folders={folders}
  onFolderChange={handleFolderChange}
  accounts={accounts}
  selectedAccount={selectedAccount}
  onAccountChange={handleAccountChange}
  onAddAccount={() => setShowAddDialog(true)}
/>
```

### No Database Changes Required! ✅
The existing schema already supports everything needed:
- `email_accounts` table with `user_id`, `email`, `sync_status`
- `emails` table with `account_id` foreign key
- Folders already linked to accounts

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### Account Selection Flow:
1. **On Page Load:**
   - Loads all user's email accounts
   - Auto-selects first account (or default account)
   - Loads folders for selected account
   - Loads emails for selected account

2. **When User Switches Account:**
   - User clicks dropdown, selects different account
   - `onAccountChange` triggered
   - Email layout updates selectedAccount
   - Folders reload for new account
   - Emails reload for new account
   - All happens seamlessly, no page reload

3. **When User Adds Account:**
   - User clicks "Add Account" in dropdown
   - Opens Add Email Account dialog
   - User connects new account
   - Account added to list
   - Newly added account auto-selected

### Folder Filtering:
- Folders already filtered by account in `getEmailFoldersAction()`
- Each account sees only its own folders
- Folder structure preserved per account
- Unread counts calculated per account
