# Organization Contacts System - Implementation Progress

## ✅ Completed (Database Layer)

### 1. Database Migration
- ✅ Created `db/migrations/0040_organization_contacts_v2.sql`
- ✅ Table structure with UUID types (matching organizations table)
- ✅ Includes all contact fields: name, title, department, email, phones, address, notes
- ✅ Primary contact designation (is_primary flag)
- ✅ Soft delete support (is_active flag)
- ✅ Performance indexes on key columns
- ✅ Foreign key to organizations with CASCADE delete
- ✅ Added primary_contact_id to projects table

### 2. Database Schema
- ✅ Created `db/schema/organization-contacts-schema.ts`
- ✅ Drizzle ORM schema with proper UUID types
- ✅ TypeScript types exported (SelectOrganizationContact, InsertOrganizationContact)
- ✅ Indexes defined
- ✅ Exported in `db/schema/index.ts`

### 3. Database Queries
- ✅ Created `db/queries/organization-contacts-queries.ts`
- ✅ `getOrganizationContacts()` - List with search, pagination, active filter
- ✅ `getContactById()` - Fetch single contact
- ✅ `getPrimaryContact()` - Get primary contact for org
- ✅ `createOrganizationContact()` - Create with primary contact logic
- ✅ `updateOrganizationContact()` - Update with primary contact logic
- ✅ `deleteOrganizationContact()` - Soft or hard delete
- ✅ `getContactCount()` - Count active contacts per org

### 4. Migration Helper
- ✅ Created `/api/fix-contacts-table` endpoint to run migration SQL

## ⏳ Next Steps

### TO RUN THE MIGRATION:
1. Ensure dev server is running: `npm run dev`
2. Visit: `http://localhost:3002/api/fix-contacts-table` in browser
3. You should see: `{"success":true,"message":"organization_contacts table created with UUID types"}`

### Then Continue With:

### 5. Server Actions (Next)
Create `actions/organization-contacts-actions.ts` with:
- `getOrganizationContactsAction` - With authorization
- `getOrganizationContactByIdAction`
- `createOrganizationContactAction`
- `updateOrganizationContactAction`
- `deleteOrganizationContactAction`
- All wrapped with `withSelfHealing()` for automatic error recovery

### 6. UI Components
Create the following components:
- `components/dashboard/organization-contact-card.tsx` - Display contact info
- `components/dashboard/add-organization-contact-dialog.tsx` - Full create form
- `components/dashboard/edit-organization-contact-dialog.tsx` - Full edit form

### 7. Dashboard Integration
Update `app/dashboard/organizations/[id]/page.tsx` to:
- Fetch organization contacts
- Display contacts grid
- Add "Add Contact" button
- Show contact cards with edit/delete options

## 📊 Progress: 4/12 Tasks Complete (33%)

## 🔧 Key Technical Decisions

1. **UUID Types**: Using UUID for all IDs to match existing organizations table
2. **Generated Column**: `full_name` is database-generated (first_name || ' ' || last_name)
3. **Soft Delete**: Using `is_active` flag instead of hard deletes
4. **Primary Contact**: Only one contact per organization can be marked primary
5. **Self-Healing**: All actions will be wrapped with auto-recovery
6. **Authorization**: User must have role in organization to manage contacts

## 🎯 What This System Does

- ✅ Multiple contacts per organization (unlimited)
- ✅ Full contact information storage
- ✅ Primary contact designation
- ✅ Search and filter contacts
- ✅ Soft delete for data retention
- ✅ Link contacts to projects (optional)
- ❌ NO pipelines or workflows (those stay in projects)
