## 🆘 Support

### If Something Doesn't Work:

1. **Check `.env.local`** - Is `OPENAI_API_KEY` set?
2. **Restart server** - Did you restart after adding the key?
3. **Check API key** - Does it start with `sk-`?
4. **Check console** - Any errors in browser/terminal?
5. **Check OpenAI billing** - Is your account active?

### Common Issues:

**"Unauthorized"**
→ Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` to `.env.local`

**"Rate limit exceeded"**
→ Wait 1 minute or adjust limit in code

**"Insufficient quota"**
→ Add payment method to OpenAI account

**Slow responses**
→ Normal for GPT-4, switch to GPT-3.5 for speed
