# AI Voice Agent Call Tracking & Workflow System
## Implementation Summary

**Implementation Date:** October 6, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Core System Complete & Functional

---

## üéØ What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema (‚úÖ Complete)
Created 6 new database tables to support the full call tracking and workflow system:

- **`project_webhooks`** - Webhook configurations for receiving call data
- **`call_records`** - Stores all call data, transcripts, and AI analysis results
- **`call_workflows`** - Admin-created automation workflows
- **`workflow_email_templates`** - Email templates for workflow actions
- **`workflow_sms_templates`** - SMS templates for workflow actions
- **`workflow_execution_logs`** - Tracks workflow execution history

All tables include proper indexes, foreign keys, and cascade deletes for data integrity.

### 2. Webhook Receiver API (‚úÖ Complete)
**File:** `app/api/webhooks/calls/[token]/route.ts`

- Public webhook endpoint: `POST /api/webhooks/calls/{token}`
- Flexible payload parsing (supports various AI voice agent platforms)
- Optional API key authentication (`X-API-Key` header)
- Automatic call record creation
- Async AI analysis queue
- Webhook stats tracking
- GET endpoint for webhook verification

**Supported Payload Fields:**
- `transcript` (required) - Call transcript text
- `caller.name`, `name`, `caller_name` - Caller's name
- `caller.phone`, `phone`, `from` - Caller's phone number
- `duration`, `call_duration`, `duration_seconds` - Call duration in seconds
- `timestamp`, `call_timestamp` - Call timestamp

### 3. AI Call Analyzer (‚úÖ Complete)
**File:** `lib/ai-call-analyzer.ts`

Uses OpenAI GPT-4 to analyze call transcripts and extract:
- **Call topic** (1-3 words summary)
- **Call summary** (2-3 sentences)
- **Questions asked** (array of questions from caller)
- **Call sentiment** (positive, neutral, negative)
- **Quality rating** (1-10 scale)
- **Follow-up needed** (boolean + reason + urgency level)
- **Additional insights** (flexible JSON for extra analysis)

All analysis happens automatically in the background after webhook receives call data.

### 4. Workflow Engine (‚úÖ Complete)
**File:** `lib/workflow-engine.ts`

Evaluates conditions and executes automated actions based on call analysis:

**Supported Condition Operators:**
- `equals`, `not_equals`
- `greater_than`, `less_than`, `greater_than_or_equal`, `less_than_or_equal`
- `contains`, `not_contains`
- `is_true`, `is_false`

**Supported Workflow Actions:**
1. **Send Email** - Send templated emails with variable interpolation
2. **Send SMS** - Send SMS via Twilio with template support
3. **Create Task** - Auto-create project tasks with assignments and due dates

**Template Variables Available:**
- `{{caller_name}}` - Caller's name
- `{{caller_phone}}` - Caller's phone number
- `{{call_topic}}` - AI-extracted topic
