## 🎨 How It Works

### Hey Views (Top Section):
- **Screener** - New senders to approve/block
- **Imbox** - Important people you've approved
- **The Feed** - Newsletters and updates
- **Paper Trail** - Receipts and confirmations
- **Reply Later** - Emails you've snoozed
- **Set Aside** - Temporarily parked emails

### Traditional Folders (Bottom Section):
- **Inbox** - All incoming mail (traditional)
- **Sent** - Emails you've sent
- **Drafts** - Unfinished emails
- **Starred** - Flagged/important
- **Archive** - Old emails
- **Trash** - Deleted items
- **Custom** - Any other folders (Work, Personal, etc.)

---

## 🔄 How Navigation Works

### Click a Hey View:
```
Click "Imbox" 
→ Shows only emails you've approved
→ Special Hey filtering
→ Modern card layout
```

### Click a Traditional Folder:
```
Click "Inbox"
→ Shows all inbox emails
→ Traditional email list
→ Standard 2-line email cards
```

### They Coexist Perfectly:
- **Hey views** use special filtering (heyView field)
- **Traditional folders** use folder names
- **Both** work simultaneously
- **Switch** between them instantly

---

## 📊 What Changed

### Files Modified:

1. **`components/email/hey-sidebar.tsx`**
   - Removed "hybrid mode only" restriction
   - Traditional folders now ALWAYS visible with Hey views
   - Changed label to "Traditional Folders" for clarity

2. **`components/email/email-layout.tsx`**
   - Updated folder detection logic
   - Hey views use `currentView`
   - Traditional folders also use `currentView`
   - Seamless switching between both

---

## 🎯 User Experience

### Before (Your Concern):
```
Hey Mode:
❌ Can only use Hey views
❌ No access to traditional folders
❌ Have to switch modes to see Inbox/Sent
```

### After (What You Have Now):
```
Hey Mode:
✅ Hey views at the top
✅ Traditional folders below
✅ Access to EVERYTHING at once
✅ Best of both worlds!
```

---

## 🔍 Example Workflows

### Workflow 1: Use Hey for Triage, Folders for Organization
```
1. Start day in Screener
   → Approve/block new senders

2. Check Imbox
   → Reply to important people

3. Switch to "Work" folder
   → Review project emails

4. Check "Sent" folder
   → Verify sent emails

5. Back to The Feed
   → Catch up on newsletters
```

### Workflow 2: Traditional First, Hey Second
```
1. Check traditional "Inbox"
   → See everything new

2. Star important emails
   → Click "Starred" folder

3. Check "Reply Later" (Hey)
   → Follow up on snoozed emails

4. Browse "Paper Trail" (Hey)
   → Find receipts and confirmations
```

### Workflow 3: Mixed Approach
```
1. "Imbox" (Hey) for VIPs
2. "Inbox" (Traditional) for everything
3. "Work" (Custom) for projects
4. "The Feed" (Hey) for newsletters
5. "Archive" (Traditional) to clean up
```

## 🎨 Visual Design

### Hey Views:
- **Gradient backgrounds**
- **Large, bold cards**
- **Color-coded categories**
- **Badge counts**
- **Modern animations**

### Traditional Folders:
- **Simple icon + text**
- **Unread counts (blue badge)**
- **Compact design**
- **Familiar layout**

### Clear Separation:
- **Border between sections**
- **Different headings** ("HEY WORKFLOW" vs "TRADITIONAL FOLDERS")
- **Different visual styles**

---

## 📝 Technical Details

### Folder Filtering Logic:

When you click a folder, the system determines what to show:

**Hey Views (Special Filtering):**
```typescript
switch (currentView) {
  case 'screener':
    return <ScreenerView />; // New senders
  case 'imbox':
    return <ImboxView />; // Approved senders
  case 'feed':
    return <FeedView />; // Newsletters
  case 'paper_trail':
    return <PaperTrailView />; // Receipts
  // ... etc
}
```

**Traditional Folders (Standard Filtering):**
```typescript
// Falls through to EmailCardList
// Filters by folder name:
- 'INBOX' → inbox emails
- 'SENT' → sent emails
- 'DRAFTS' → draft emails
- 'STARRED' → starred emails
- 'Work' → custom folder "Work"
- etc.
```

### Smart Detection:

The system automatically knows:
- If `currentView` is a Hey view → Use Hey component
- If `currentView` is a folder → Use EmailCardList with folder filter
- No manual mode switching needed!
