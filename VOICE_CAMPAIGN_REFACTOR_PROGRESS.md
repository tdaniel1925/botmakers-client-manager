## ✅ Phase 1: Foundation & Infrastructure (COMPLETE)

### 1.1 State Management Setup ✅

**Created:**
- `lib/stores/campaign-store.ts` - Zustand store with:
  - Centralized campaign state
  - Optimistic updates with automatic rollback
  - Automatic refetching with 30-second cache
  - Actions: setCampaigns, addCampaign, updateCampaign, deleteCampaign, fetchCampaigns

**Modified:**
- `components/voice-campaigns/campaigns-page-wrapper.tsx`
  - ❌ Removed `window.location.reload()` (lines 20, 42)
  - ✅ Uses campaign store with fetchCampaigns
  - ✅ Automatic refetch on mount
  - ✅ Pass campaign object to wizard onComplete

- `components/voice-campaigns/campaign-card.tsx`
  - ❌ Removed `window.location.reload()` (lines 47, 59)
  - ✅ Optimistic updates for pause/resume
  - ✅ Automatic rollback on error
  - ✅ Store integration for all actions

- `components/voice-campaigns/campaigns-list.tsx`
  - ✅ Uses store instead of local state
  - ✅ Loading skeleton integration
  - ✅ Auto-refresh phone number status

- `components/voice-campaigns/campaign-wizard.tsx`
  - ✅ Updated onComplete signature to pass campaign object

**Impact:**

   - Custom confirmation dialog (replaces native `confirm()`)
   - Variants: danger, warning, info

   - Animated pulse for active campaigns
   - Icon indicators for each status

**Modified:**
- `components/voice-campaigns/campaign-card.tsx`
  - ❌ Replaced native `confirm()` with ConfirmDialog
  - ✅ Requires typing campaign name to delete
  - ✅ Uses CampaignStatusBadge and ProviderBadge
