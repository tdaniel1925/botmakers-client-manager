## 🎯 Key Features Explained

### 1. **Primary Contact Logic**
- Only ONE contact per organization can be marked as primary
- When setting a new primary, the system automatically unsets the previous one
- Enforced at the database query level for data integrity

### 2. **Soft Delete**
- Contacts are never permanently deleted
- Setting `is_active = false` archives them
- Preserves historical data
- Can be restored if needed

### 3. **Full Contact Information**
- Multiple phone numbers (main, mobile, office)
- Complete address fields
- Department and job title
- Notes for additional context

### 4. **Search & Filter**
- Search across name, email, and phone
- Real-time results
- Pagination support (up to 100 contacts per page)
- Filter by active status

---

## 🔄 Integration Points

### With Existing Systems:

1. **Organizations**
   - Contacts belong to organizations
   - Access controlled by organization roles
   - Users see only their organizations' contacts

2. **Projects** (Optional)
   - `primary_contact_id` column added to projects table
   - Can link a contact as the main project contact
   - Helps track who's responsible for each project

3. **Self-Healing System**
   - All operations protected
   - Automatic error recovery
   - Visible in System Health dashboard

## 🎯 Separation from Projects CRM

### Organization Contacts (This System):
- **Purpose:** Simple contact directory
- **Scope:** Organization-level contacts
- **Features:** Name, phone, email, address
- **Use Case:** "Who works at Company X?"

### Projects CRM (Separate System):
- **Purpose:** Full sales pipeline
- **Scope:** Deal-level contacts with stages
- **Features:** Pipelines, workflows, deal tracking
- **Use Case:** "Track this specific deal through our sales process"

**They coexist independently** - one is a phone book, the other is a sales CRM.
