# Removed "Both" Campaign Type Option

## Overview

Removed the "both" (inbound + outbound) campaign type option from the UI to simplify the campaign creation flow. Users now choose between:
- **Inbound** - Receive customer calls
- **Outbound** - Make calls proactively (with smart scheduling)

## Why This Change?

1. **Simplification** - Having three options was confusing
2. **Clear Use Cases** - Most campaigns are either inbound OR outbound, not both
3. **Scheduling Clarity** - Scheduling only applies to outbound campaigns
4. **Twilio Issue Independence** - The Twilio webhook issue was unrelated to campaign type

## What Changed

### UI Components Updated

#### 1. Campaign Setup Questions
**File:** `types/campaign-setup-questions.ts`

- Removed "both" option from campaign_type question
- Updated outbound description to mention "smart scheduling"
- Now only shows 2 options: inbound and outbound

#### 2. Campaign Settings Dialog
**File:** `components/voice-campaigns/campaign-settings-dialog-enhanced.tsx`

- Removed "both" option from dropdown
- Updated type definitions: `"inbound" | "outbound"` (no more `| "both"`)
- Updated helper text to remove "both" description

#### 3. Campaign Wizard
**File:** `components/voice-campaigns/campaign-wizard.tsx`

- Updated scheduling conditional to only check for `"outbound"`
- Removed `|| answers.campaign_type === "both"` condition
- Passes explicit `"outbound"` to ScheduleConfigForm

#### 4. Schedule Config Form
**File:** `components/voice-campaigns/schedule-config-form.tsx`

- Updated type: `campaignType?: "inbound" | "outbound"` (removed `| "both"`)
- Changed default from `"both"` to `"outbound"`
- Updated comment: "Only show for outbound campaigns"
- Simplified condition: `showScheduling = campaignType === "outbound"`

#### 5. Launch Campaign Dialog
**File:** `components/voice-campaigns/launch-campaign-dialog.tsx`

- Removed conditional block for `campaign.campaignType === "both"`
- Removed "Handle both incoming and outbound calls" messaging
- Now only shows inbound or outbound specific messages

#### 6. Campaign Actions
**File:** `actions/voice-campaign-actions.ts`

- Updated `updateCampaignConfigAction` type: `campaignType?: "inbound" | "outbound"` (no more `| "both"`)

## Database Schema (NOT Changed)

**File:** `db/schema/voice-campaigns-schema.ts`

The database enum **still includes "both"** for backward compatibility:

```typescript
export const campaignTypeEnum = pgEnum("campaign_type", [
  "inbound",    // Receive calls
  "outbound",   // Make calls
  "both"        // Both inbound and outbound (deprecated in UI)
]);
```

### Why Keep It In Database?

1. **No Migration Required** - Avoids complex database migration
2. **Backward Compatibility** - Existing "both" campaigns continue to work
3. **Data Integrity** - Prevents breaking existing records
4. **UI Enforcement** - Users can't create new "both" campaigns, but existing ones remain functional

## User Impact

### Before
- Users saw 3 confusing options
- "Both" option unclear about when scheduling applies
- Unnecessary complexity for most use cases

### After
- Clear binary choice: inbound OR outbound
- Scheduling automatically appears for outbound only
- Simpler, more intuitive campaign creation
- Existing "both" campaigns still work but can't create new ones

## Scheduling Behavior

### Inbound Campaigns
- **No scheduling configuration shown**
- Phone number receives calls 24/7
- No contact list needed

### Outbound Campaigns
- **Scheduling configuration required**
- Smart call scheduling with timezone awareness
- Contact list and calling windows needed
- Max attempts, delays, and concurrency controls

## Migration Path for Existing "Both" Campaigns

If needed in the future, we can:

1. **Option A: Convert to Outbound**
   - Run SQL script to change all "both" → "outbound"
   - Preserve all scheduling configs
   - Add note in description

2. **Option B: Keep As-Is**
   - Leave "both" campaigns unchanged
   - They'll continue working normally
   - UI just won't let users create new ones

3. **Option C: Add UI Toggle**
   - If needed, add admin toggle to show/hide "both" option
   - Platform admins could enable for specific orgs
