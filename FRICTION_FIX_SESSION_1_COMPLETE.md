  requireTyping: true,
  typingConfirmText: "DELETE",

## üéØ Next Steps

### Immediate (Complete Phase A)

**Finish Confirm() Dialogs** (1.5-2 hours)

Template for remaining files:
```typescript
// 1. Add import
import { useConfirm } from "@/hooks/use-confirm";

// 2. Add hook at component start
const { confirm, ConfirmDialog } = useConfirm();

// 3. Replace confirm() calls
// Before:
if (!confirm("Are you sure?")) return;

// After:
const confirmed = await confirm({
  title: "Delete Item?",
  description: "This action cannot be undone.",
  variant: "danger",
});
if (!confirmed) return;

// 4. Add dialog to return
return (
  <>
    {/* ... component JSX ... */}
    <ConfirmDialog />
  </>
);
```

**Files to Update:**
1. `components/calls/template-manager.tsx`
2. `components/calls/webhook-manager.tsx`
3. `app/platform/dev/seed-data/page.tsx`
4. `app/dashboard/team/page.tsx`
5. `app/platform/organizations/[id]/page.tsx`
6. `components/dashboard/members-table.tsx`
7. `app/platform/templates/page.tsx`
8. `components/platform/admin-template-manager.tsx`
9. `components/platform/admin-todo-review-panel.tsx`
10. `components/project/project-tasks-list.tsx`

### Phase B: Search & Bulk Actions (2-3 days)

After Phase A is complete, move to highest-impact features:

1. **Add Search to Contacts** (2-3 hours)
   - Search by name, email, company
   - Filter by status, tags
   
2. **Add Search to Deals** (4-5 hours)
   - Search by title
   - Filter by value range, probability, close date
   
3. **Add Search to Activities** (4-5 hours)

## üí° Key Insights

### What We Learned

1. **Voice campaigns are WAY ahead**
   - Already has Zustand store
   - Already has bulk actions
   - Already has search/filters
   - Already has loading skeletons

   - Consistency is key

3. **Hard refreshes were #1 UX killer**
   - Eliminated ALL of them

## üìù Notes for Next Session

### Quick Start

3. Pattern is consistent across all files
4. Should take ~10-15 minutes per file

### After Confirms
1. Start with search on contacts (easiest)
2. Copy pattern from tasks list
3. Apply to deals, activities
4. Then move to bulk actions

### Reference Files
- **Bulk Actions:** `components/voice-campaigns/bulk-action-toolbar.tsx`

- **Confirm Dialog:** `hooks/use-confirm.tsx`
- **Store Pattern:** `lib/stores/campaign-store.ts`

## üéâ Celebration

We eliminated the #1 UX problem (hard refreshes) and set up the infrastructure (useConfirm hook) to quickly fix all remaining confirm() dialogs!

The app now feels SIGNIFICANTLY more professional and modern. Users will immediately notice the smooth, responsive behavior.

**Great progress! üöÄ**
