## Security & Permissions

- ✅ **Platform Admin Only** - All delete operations require platform admin role
- ✅ **Server-Side Validation** - Actions validate permissions on server
- ✅ **Audit Logging** - All deletions logged with organization context
- ✅ **Error Handling** - Graceful error messages for failures

## Data Integrity

### Cascading Deletions
When a project is deleted, the database CASCADE rules automatically delete:
- Associated project tasks
- Project notes
- Project progress data
- Onboarding sessions
- Related audit logs

⚠️ **Warning:** The confirmation dialog warns users about these cascading deletions.

## Toast Notifications

Uses the new enhanced toast system:

### Success Messages:
```typescript
// Single delete
toast.success("Project deleted", {
  description: "ProjectName has been deleted successfully."
});

// Bulk delete
toast.success("Projects deleted", {
  description: "5 project(s) deleted successfully."
});
```

### Error Messages:
```typescript
toast.error("Delete failed", {
  description: "Failed to delete project."
});

toast.error("Error occurred", {
  description: "An unexpected error occurred."
});
```

## Testing Checklist

### Single Delete (List)
- [ ] Delete button appears in dropdown menu
- [ ] Confirmation dialog shows project name
- [ ] Cancel button works
- [ ] Delete button triggers deletion
- [ ] Toast notification appears
- [ ] Project removed from list
- [ ] Page refreshes correctly

### Bulk Delete (List)
- [ ] Checkboxes appear for all projects
- [ ] "Select all" checkbox works
- [ ] Bulk actions bar appears when items selected
- [ ] Selection count is accurate
- [ ] "Clear Selection" button works
- [ ] Confirmation dialog shows correct count
- [ ] All selected projects are deleted
- [ ] Toast shows success count
- [ ] Page refreshes correctly

### Delete (Detail Page)
- [ ] Delete button enabled in dropdown
- [ ] Confirmation dialog appears
- [ ] Warning message about data loss shows
- [ ] Cancel button works
- [ ] Delete triggers deletion
- [ ] Redirects to projects list
- [ ] Toast notification appears

### Error Scenarios
- [ ] Non-admin users can't access delete functions
- [ ] Deleting non-existent project shows error
- [ ] Network errors handled gracefully
- [ ] Partial bulk delete failures reported correctly

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Empty selection (bulk delete button should be disabled)
- [ ] Deleting last project on page
- [ ] Deleting while on filtered/searched results
- [ ] Rapid clicking doesn't create duplicate requests

## Performance Considerations

- **Bulk Delete:** Processes sequentially to ensure audit logs
- **Loading States:** Buttons disabled during operations
- **Optimistic Updates:** Page refresh after successful deletion
- **Error Recovery:** Individual failures in bulk don't stop other deletions

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- [ ] Soft delete with "trash" folder
- [ ] Undo functionality
- [ ] Export before delete option
- [ ] Archive instead of delete
- [ ] Bulk actions for other operations (archive, change status, etc.)
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts (Del key for selected items)
- [ ] Drag-and-drop to trash
